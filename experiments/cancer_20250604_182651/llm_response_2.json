    "response": "Here are specific clarification questions to help identify relevant ontologies (Cell Ontology, Gene Ontology, and MeSH terms) for the described system:  \n\n1. **Cell Types & States**:  \n   - Is the cancerous cell of a specific type (e.g., epithelial, mesenchymal, leukemia)?  \n   - Are the \"other cells\" being invaded normal cells, immune cells, or other cancerous cells?  \n   - Does the cancerous cell exhibit any specific state (e.g., circulating tumor cell, metastatic)?  \n\n2. **Biological Processes (GO)**:  \n   - Is the invasion mediated by specific processes like *cell migration*, *extracellular matrix degradation*, or *epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)*?  \n   - Are there known signaling pathways involved (e.g., Wnt, TGF-\u03b2, integrin signaling)?  \n\n3. **Molecular Functions (GO)**:  \n   - Are there key proteins/enzymes facilitating invasion (e.g., *matrix metalloproteinases*, *cadherins*, *integrins*)?  \n   - Does the cell exhibit altered adhesion or motility functions?  \n\n4. **Cellular Components (GO)**:  \n   - Are specific structures involved (e.g., *invadopodia*, *lamellipodia*, *basement membrane*)?  \n\n5. **Disease & Anatomy (MeSH)**:  \n   - Is this related to a specific cancer (e.g., *breast neoplasms*, *melanoma*, *carcinoma*)?  \n   - What is the tissue/organ context (e.g., *bone metastasis*, *brain invasion*)?  \n\n6. **Experimental Context**:  \n   - Is this based on *in vitro* (e.g., *cell culture models*) or *in vivo* (e.g., *xenograft models*) observations?  \n\n7. **Additional Mechanisms**:  \n   - Does the invasion involve *cell-cell fusion*, *trogocytosis*, or *mechanical force*?  \n\nThese questions will help map the system to precise ontology terms for modeling. Let me know if you'd like refinements!"
