    "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file based on the provided ontology annotations. Let me break down the requirements and figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the user provided specific ontology terms: CellOntology includes Mesenchymal and Epithelial cells, GeneOntology includes Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition and Cell Division, and MeSH includes Cell Proliferation. So, the simulation should model EMT and cell division.\n\nI'll start by setting up the necessary imports. CompuCell3D requires importing CompuCellSetup and steppables, so I'll include those. Also, since the simulation uses a Mitosis steppable, I'll import Mitosis from steppables.\n\nNext, I'll create a simulation class that inherits from SteppableBasePy. This class needs __init__, start, and step methods. In the __init__, I'll set the number of cells, define cell types, and initialize the EMT and cell cycle parameters.\n\nIn the start method, I'll create a lattice and place cells. I'll use a 2D simulation for simplicity, placing Epithelial and Mesenchymal cells in a grid. Then, I'll add the necessary steppables: Mitosis for cell division and a MitochondrialDNAVolumeSteppable for tracking.\n\nFor the EMT process, I'll create a dictionary to hold transition parameters, setting the transition probability and duration. I'll also set up a cell cycle model with initial phase and duration to control cell division.\n\nIn the step method, I'll update the simulation by stepping through each cell and handling EMT transitions. I'll check if a cell is ready to transition and change its type accordingly. Then, I'll run the standard simulation step.\n\nI'll also include a main function to initialize and run the simulation, setting the output directory and number of steps. This ensures the simulation can be executed properly.\n\nThroughout, I'll make sure to use the correct cell types and parameters based on the ontology terms provided. This includes handling both Epithelial and Mesenchymal cells, their transitions, and proliferation.\n\nI think that covers all the requirements. Now, I'll structure the code accordingly, ensuring each part is correctly implemented and integrated.\n</think>\n\n```python\nfrom CompuCell3D import CompuCellSetup\nfrom steppables import *\nfrom Mitosis import Mitosis\n\nclass EMTAndProliferationSimulation(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, _simulator, _num_cells):\n        SteppableBasePy.__init__(self, _simulator)\n        self.num_cells = _num_cells\n        self.cell_types = {'Mesenchymal': 1, 'Epithelial': 2}\n        self.emt_parameters = {'transition_probability': 0.1, 'transition_duration': 10}\n        self.cell_cycle_parameters = {'initial_phase': 1, 'phase_duration': 10}\n\n    def start(self):\n        self.simulator.createLattice(10, 10, 1)\n        self.simulator.addLatticeField(\"Cell\", \"Cell\")\n        self.simulator.addLatticeField(\"MitochondrialDNA\", \"MitochondrialDNA\")\n\n        for x in range(10):\n            for y in range(10):\n                if (x + y) % 2 == 0:\n                    self.simulator.cellField[x, y, 0] = self.cell_types['Epithelial']\n                else:\n                    self.simulator.cellField[x, y, 0] = self.cell_types['Mesenchymal']\n\n        self.simulator.addSteppable(Mitosis(self.simulator, {self.cell_types['Epithelial']: 1, self.cell_types['Mesenchymal']: 1}))\n        self.simulator.addSteppable(MitochondrialDNAVolumeSteppable(self.simulator))\n\n        self.emt_transitions = {}\n        self.cell_cycle_model = CellCycleModel(self.simulator, self.cell_cycle_parameters)\n\n    def step(self, mcs):\n        for cell in self.simulator.cellList:\n            if cell.type == self.cell_types['Epithelial']:\n                if self.emt_transitions.get(cell.id, 0) > self.emt_parameters['transition_duration']:\n                    cell.type = self.cell_types['Mesenchymal']\n                    self.emt_transitions[cell.id] = 0\n                else:\n                    self.emt_transitions[cell.id] += 1\n\n        self.cell_cycle_model.step()\n        self.simulator.step()\n\ndef main():\n    simulator = CompuCellSetup.Simulator()\n    simulator.setSimulationDimensions(10, 10, 1)\n    simulator.setNumThreads(4)\n    simulator.setTimeStep(1.0)\n    simulator.setTimeTotal(100.0)\n    simulator.setOutputDirectory(\"EMTAndProliferation\")\n\n    simulation = EMTAndProliferationSimulation(simulator, 100)\n    simulator.addSteppable(simulation)\n    simulator.run()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```"
