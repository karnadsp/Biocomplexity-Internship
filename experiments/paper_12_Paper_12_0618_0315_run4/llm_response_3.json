    "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file based on the given ontology annotations. The user provided a Python code example, but I should think through how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the ontology terms: Epithelial cells, Cell Division, and Cell Proliferation. So the simulation should model epithelial cell proliferation, which likely involves cell division.\n\nI know that CompuCell3D uses Python for scripting simulations. The code should include imports, a simulation class, and necessary methods.\n\nThe user's example includes imports like CompuCellSetup and steppables. I'll need to import these. Also, since cell proliferation involves growth, I'll probably need a growth steppable.\n\nThe simulation class should inherit from SteppableBasePy. The __init__ method initializes the steppable, start sets initial conditions, and step updates each iteration.\n\nFor the cell types, I'll define 'Epithelial' with a nucleus. Parameters might include lattice spacing, time steps, and growth-related parameters like target volume and growth rate.\n\nI'll set up the simulation with a 2D lattice, add a growth steppable, and an mitosis steppable to handle cell division. The output should include a Potts tracker to save simulation data.\n\nI need to make sure the code is valid and runs without errors. I'll structure it step by step, ensuring each part is correctly implemented.\n</think>\n\n```python\nfrom CompuCell3D import CompuCellSetup\nfrom steppables import *\nfrom PySteppables import *\nimport sys\n\nclass EpithelialProliferationSimulation(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, _simulator, _frequency=1):\n        SteppableBasePy.__init__(self, _simulator, _frequency)\n        self.simulator = _simulator\n        self.frequency = _frequency\n\n    def start(self):\n        # Initialize cells\n        cell = self.simulator.cellField\n        cell.defaultCellType = self.simulator.cellTypeDictionary['Epithelial']\n\n        # Add a single epithelial cell at the center\n        x = y = z = self.simulator.latticeSize.x // 2\n        cell(x, y, z).type = self.simulator.cellTypeDictionary['Epithelial']\n\n        # Set up cell proliferation parameters\n        self.simulator.addSteppable(_steppable=GrowthSteppable(\n            model_id='epithelial_growth',\n            cell_type='Epithelial',\n            target_volume=25,\n            growth_rate=0.1,\n            max_volume=100\n        ))\n\n        # Set up cell division\n        self.simulator.addSteppable(_steppable=MitosisSteppable(\n            model_id='epithelial_mitosis',\n            cell_type='Epithelial',\n            mitosis_distance=5,\n            mitosis_rate=0.1\n        ))\n\n    def step(self, mcs):\n        pass\n\n    def finish(self):\n        pass\n\ndef main():\n    # Set up simulation\n    sim = CompuCellSetup.Simulator()\n    sim.simulationDimensions.x = 100\n    sim.simulationDimensions.y = 100\n    sim.simulationDimensions.z = 1\n\n    # Set up cell types\n    sim.registerCellType(\n        cellType='Epithelial',\n        nucleus=CompuCellSetup.Nucleus(),\n        cellId=1\n    )\n\n    # Add simulation steppables\n    sim.addSteppable(EpithelialProliferationSimulation(sim, 1))\n\n    # Set up output\n    sim.addPottsTracker()\n    sim.addMitosisSteppable()\n\n    # Run simulation\n    sim.run(1000)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```"
