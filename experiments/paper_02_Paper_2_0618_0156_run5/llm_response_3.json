    "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file based on the given ontology annotations. The user provided a Python code example, but I have to create my own. Let me break down the requirements.\n\nFirst, the code must include the necessary imports. I remember that CompuCell3D uses modules like CompuCellSetup and steppables. So I'll import CompuCellSetup, which is essential for setting up the simulation. Then, I'll import the specific steppables, like PySteppable, from the steppables module.\n\nNext, I need a simulation class that inherits from SteppableBasePy. The example used SimulationClass, so I'll follow that structure. The class should have __init__, start, and step methods. In __init__, I'll call the parent's __init__ method and set up any necessary parameters, like the number of cells.\n\nThe ontology annotations mention Epithelial cells, Cell Division, and Cell Proliferation. So I'll focus on cell division. I'll need to set up cell types and parameters. I'll define a cell type for Epithelial cells with a specific name, type id, and color. Then, I'll set parameters for cell division, such as the number of cells, division distance, and the number of steps between divisions.\n\nIn the start method, I'll create a lattice and place the initial cells. I'll loop through the number of cells, placing each at random positions. I'll also set their type to Epithelial and assign a nucleus to each.\n\nFor the step method, I'll calculate the number of cells at each step and print it. This helps track cell proliferation over time. I'll also set a condition to stop the simulation when a certain number of cells is reached, say 100, to prevent it from running indefinitely.\n\nI should also include the main function to initialize and run the simulation. This involves creating an instance of the simulation class, setting the simulation parameters like output directory and number of steps, and then running the simulation.\n\nI need to make sure all the methods are correctly implemented and that the code is clean and well-structured. I'll avoid any unnecessary comments or explanations since the user requested only the Python code.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll structure the code with the imports at the top, followed by the simulation class, and then the main function. I'll ensure that all the parameters and methods align with the ontology annotations provided, focusing on cell division and proliferation.\n</think>\n\n```python\nfrom CompuCell3D import CompuCellSetup\nfrom steppables import PySteppable, SteppableBasePy\n\nclass SimulationClass(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, _simulator, _num_cells):\n        SteppableBasePy.__init__(self, _simulator)\n        self.num_cells = _num_cells\n        self.cell_type = 'Epithelial'\n        self.cell_type_id = 0\n        self.cell_color = _rgb(255, 255, 255)\n        self.division_distance = 1.0\n        self.division_step = 100\n\n    def start(self):\n        self.cell_field = self.simulator.get_cell_field()\n        self.lattice = self.simulator.get_lattice()\n        self.create_cells()\n\n    def step(self, mcs):\n        num_cells = self.cell_field.get_number_of_cells()\n        print(f\"Number of cells at step {mcs}: {num_cells}\")\n        if num_cells >= 100:\n            self.simulator.stop()\n\n    def create_cells(self):\n        for i in range(self.num_cells):\n            cell = self.cell_field.find_cell_by_type(self.cell_type_id)\n            x = self.lattice.x_length * 0.5 + (i % 10) * 1.0\n            y = self.lattice.y_length * 0.5 + (i // 10) * 1.0\n            self.cell_field.add_cell(cell, (x, y, 0))\n            cell.type = self.cell_type_id\n            cell.nucleus = 1\n\ndef main():\n    simulator = CompuCellSetup.Simulator()\n    simulator.set_output_directory(\"output\")\n    simulator.set_num_steps(1000)\n    simulator.set_num_threads(4)\n    simulator.add_steppable(SimulationClass(simulator, 10))\n    simulator.run()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```"
