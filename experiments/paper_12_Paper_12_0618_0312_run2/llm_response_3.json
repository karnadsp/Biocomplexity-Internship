    "response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file based on the provided ontology annotations. Let me break down the steps.\n\nFirst, the user specified that the code must include certain elements: imports, a simulation class inheriting from SteppableBasePy, and specific methods. The ontology terms are Epithelial cells, Cell Division, and Cell Proliferation.\n\nI'll start by importing the necessary modules. I know CompuCellSetup is needed, and from steppables, I'll need SteppableBasePy. Also, since the simulation involves cell division, I'll import MitosisSteppable.\n\nNext, I'll create the simulation class. It should inherit from SteppableBasePy. In the __init__ method, I'll set the number of steps between mitosis events, perhaps every 100 steps. I'll also initialize a counter for tracking.\n\nIn the start method, I'll set up the basic cell type as Epithelial. This involves getting the default cell type and renaming it. Then, I'll set some parameters like proliferation rate and maximum cell cycle length.\n\nThe step method is where the logic for cell division happens. I'll check if the current step modulo the mitosis interval is zero. If so, I'll get all cells of Epithelial type and trigger mitosis for each. I'll also increment the mitosis counter.\n\nFinally, I'll create an instance of the simulation class. I'll name it cell_proliferation_simulation and pass the required parameters, including the number of steps and the output frequency.\n\nI should make sure the code is clean and only includes the necessary parts without any extra explanations. I'll structure it so that each method is properly defined and the logic flows correctly.\n</think>\n\n```python\nfrom CompuCell3D import CompuCellSetup\nfrom steppables import SteppableBasePy, MitosisSteppable\n\nclass CellProliferationSimulation(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, _simulator, _frequency=1):\n        SteppableBasePy.__init__(self, _simulator, _frequency)\n        self.simulator = _simulator\n        self.step_counter = 0\n        self.mitosistep = 100  # Cells will divide every 100 steps\n\n    def start(self):\n        # Initialize cell type and properties\n        self.cell_type = self.simulator.get_cell_type(\"Epithelial\")\n        self.simulator.set_cell_type(self.cell_type)\n        # Set cell proliferation parameters\n        self.proliferation_rate = 0.1\n        self.max_cell_cycle_length = 100\n\n    def step(self):\n        self.step_counter += 1\n        if self.step_counter % self.mitosistep == 0:\n            # Trigger cell division for all Epithelial cells\n            cell_list = self.simulator.get_cells_by_type(self.cell_type)\n            for cell in cell_list:\n                self.simulator.mitosis(cell)\n\n# Create simulation instance\nsimulator = CompuCellSetup.Simulator()\nsimulator.setSimulationDimensions(50, 50, 1)\nsimulator.setSimulationTime(1000, 100)\nsimulator.addSteerable(CellProliferationSimulation(simulator, 1))\nsimulator.run()\n```"
