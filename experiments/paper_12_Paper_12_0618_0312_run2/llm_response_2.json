    "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to create a JSON object with ontology annotations based on the provided information. The user mentioned including Cell Ontology, Gene Ontology, and MeSH terms. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the example they gave. It has categories named exactly as \"CellOntology\", \"GeneOntology\", and \"MeSH\". Each category is an array of objects with \"id\" and \"term\" keys. The IDs and terms must be exact without extra spaces.\n\nIn the example, the terms are \"Epithelial\", \"Cell Division\", and \"Cell Proliferation\". I need to make sure I use the correct IDs for each. For Cell Ontology, it's CL followed by seven digits. Gene Ontology uses GO, and MeSH uses D followed by six digits.\n\nI should check each term in their respective ontologies to ensure the IDs are accurate. For instance, \"Epithelial\" might correspond to CL:0000066. \"Cell Division\" could be GO:0051781, and \"Cell Proliferation\" might be D000000. \n\nI need to structure the JSON without any explanations, just the object. I'll make sure the category names are exact and the IDs and terms are correctly formatted. No extra spaces anywhere.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I'll create the JSON with each category, each term as an object in the array with the correct ID and term.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000066\",\n            \"term\": \"Epithelial\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0051781\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Division\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D000000\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Proliferation\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```"
