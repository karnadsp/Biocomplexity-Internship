    "prompt": "Original description: This paper presents simulations of in vitro Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). The conditions of 2D migration on the surface, and 3D invasion into a collagen gel are represented as a cellular Potts model. The model demonstrates that a loss of endocardial adhesion is a sufficient condition for 2D migration behaviour, while a simultaneous loss of endocardial cohesion and gain in endocardial to collagen gel adhesion is a sufficient condition for 3D invasion. The 3D model captures the hierarchy effective surface tensions that correspond to the three experimental conditions of stable monolayer, 2D migration, and 3D invasion. A 2D cellular Potts model is used to investigate the relationship between cell shape changes, motility and adhesion during the condition of 2D migration.\n\nClarifications provided: \n\n\n    Return ONLY a JSON object with ontology annotations.",

    "response": "<think> \n Alright ,  I  need  to  create  a  JSON  object  with  ontology  annotations  based  on  the  provided  paper  description .  The  user  wants  me  to  include  terms  from  Cell  Ont ology ,  GO ,  and  Me SH .  \n\n First ,  I 'll  read  through  the  original  description  to  identify  key  biological  concepts .  The  paper  is  about  Ep ith elial  to  Mes ench ym al  Transition  ( EM T )  simulations  in  vitro .  They  use  a  cellular  P otts  model  to  simulate   2 D  migration  and   3 D  invasion  into  collagen  gel .\n\n I 'll  start  with  the  Cell  Ont ology .  E MT  is  a  process ,  so  I 'll  look  for  the  corresponding  term .  \" Ep ith elial  to  mes ench ym al  transition \"  is  CL : 000 035 5 .  For  cell  migration ,  the  general  term  is  CL : 001 222 9 .  Since  they  mention   2 D  and   3 D  environments ,  I 'll  include  \" 2 D  cell  migration \"  ( CL : 000 257 2 )  and  \" 3 D  cell  migration \"  ( CL : 000 257 3 ).  Coll agen  gel  is  a  matrix ,  so  \" extr acellular  matrix \"  is  CL : 000 023 5 .\n\n Next ,  for  Gene  Ont ology  ( GO ),  biological  processes  related  to  E MT ,  migration ,  and  ad hesion  come  to  mind .  \" Ep ith elial  to  mes ench ym al  transition \"  ( GO : 001 071 8 ),  \" cell  migration \"  ( GO : 001 647 7 ),  \" cell  ad hesion \"  ( GO : 009 860 9 ),  and  \" cell  mot ility \"  ( GO : 006 097 6 ).  The  cellular  P otts  model  relates  to  \" cell  shape \"  changes ,  so  \" cell  shape \"  ( GO : 000 836 0 )  is  appropriate .\n\n Now ,  Me SH  terms .  E MT  is  a  Me SH  term  ( D 053 801 ).  Cell  migration  ( A 11 . 850 . 596 . 577 )  and  cell  ad hesion  ( A 11 . 850 . 596 . 568 )  are  relevant .  Coll agen  is  a  Me SH  term  ( D 003 094 ),  and  models ,  biological  ( J 01 . 576 . 607 . 200 )  fits  the  cellular  P otts  model .\n\n I 'll  structure  these  into  a  JSON  object  with  separate  categories  for  each  ontology  type .  I  need  to  ensure  each  term  is  correctly  placed  under  its  respective  category  without  any  explanations ,  just  the  JSON  structure .\n </think> \n\n ``` json \n {\n    \" Cell  Ont ology \":  {\n      \" Ep ith elial  to  mes ench ym al  transition \":  \" CL : 000 035 5 \",\n      \" Cell  migration \":  \" CL : 001 222 9 \",\n      \" 2 D  cell  migration \":  \" CL : 000 257 2 \",\n      \" 3 D  cell  migration \":  \" CL : 000 257 3 \",\n      \" Ex tr acellular  matrix \":  \" CL : 000 023 5 \"\n    },\n    \" Gene  Ont ology \":  {\n      \" Ep ith elial  to  mes ench ym al  transition \":  \" GO : 001 071 8 \",\n      \" Cell  migration \":  \" GO : 001 647 7 \",\n      \" Cell  ad hesion \":  \" GO : 009 860 9 \",\n      \" Cell  mot ility \":  \" GO : 006 097 6 \",\n      \" Cell  shape \":  \" GO : 000 836 0 \"\n    },\n    \" Me SH \":  {\n      \" Ep ith elial  to  mes ench ym al  transition \":  \" D 053 801 \",\n      \" Cell  migration \":  \" A 11 . 850 . 596 . 577 \",\n      \" Cell  ad hesion \":  \" A 11 . 850 . 596 . 568 \",\n      \" Coll agen \":  \" D 003 094 \",\n      \" Models ,  biological \":  \" J 01 . 576 . 607 . 200 \"\n    }\n }\n ``` "
