    "response": "Here are specific clarification questions to help identify relevant ontologies (Cell Ontology, Gene Ontology, and MeSH terms) for the system involving \"two cells\":  \n\n1. **Cell Types & Identity**  \n   - Are the two cells of the same type (e.g., two neurons) or different types (e.g., a neuron and a glial cell)?  \n   - If known, what are their specific names or classifications (e.g., \"CD4+ T cell\" vs. \"macrophage\")?  \n\n2. **Biological Process & Interaction**  \n   - Are these cells interacting (e.g., synaptic signaling, immune synapse, gap junction communication)?  \n   - If so, what is the nature of their interaction (e.g., ligand-receptor binding, phagocytosis)?  \n\n3. **Cellular Components & Localization**  \n   - Are specific subcellular structures involved (e.g., axons, dendrites, membrane receptors, organelles)?  \n   - Is their spatial relationship important (e.g., cell-cell adhesion, extracellular matrix contact)?  \n\n4. **Functional Context**  \n   - What broader biological process is this system part of (e.g., immune response, neural development, wound healing)?  \n   - Are there specific molecular functions (e.g., ion transport, cytokine secretion) tied to these cells?  \n\n5. **Disease or Experimental Relevance**  \n   - Is this system studied in a disease context (e.g., cancer metastasis, autoimmune disorders)?  \n   - Are there experimental techniques involved (e.g., co-culture assays, live-cell imaging)?  \n\n6. **Gene/Protein Involvement**  \n   - Are specific genes or proteins known to be expressed or active in these cells (e.g., *CXCR4* in chemotaxis)?  \n   - Would molecular pathways (e.g., Wnt signaling, apoptosis) be relevant?  \n\n7. **Scale & Dynamics**  \n   - Is this a static snapshot or a dynamic process (e.g., cell migration, division)?  \n   - Are temporal stages (e.g., differentiation states) important?  \n\nThese questions will guide the selection of precise ontology terms (e.g., CL for cell types, GO for processes/functions, MeSH for diseases/techniques). Let me know if you'd like refinements!"
