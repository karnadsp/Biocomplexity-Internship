    "response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file based on the provided ontology annotations. Let me break down the requirements and figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the user has specified that the code must include certain elements: imports, a simulation class inheriting from SteppableBasePy, and specific methods like __init__, start, and step. Additionally, the simulation should be based on the given ontology terms, which relate to cell division and proliferation.\n\nI'll start by including the necessary imports. CompuCell3D typically requires importing CompuCellSetup and various steppables, so I'll make sure to include those.\n\nNext, I'll create the simulation class. It should inherit from SteppableBasePy. In the __init__ method, I'll set up the simulation, including the number of cells, lattice dimensions, and time parameters. I'll choose a 2D lattice for simplicity, with a size that allows for cell growth and division.\n\nThe start method is where I'll initialize the simulation. I'll create a field for cell types, setting all cells to Epithelial. I'll also set up a dictionary to track cell counts over time, initializing it with the starting cell count.\n\nFor the step method, I'll increment the simulation step and handle cell division. Every 50 steps, I'll find a random Epithelial cell and divide it into two daughter cells. This represents cell proliferation. I'll also update the cell count tracker each step.\n\nI'll set the simulation parameters, such as the number of steps, output frequency, and solver for the lattice. Finally, I'll run the simulation using CompuCellSetup.run().\n\nI need to ensure that the code is clean and only includes the necessary parts without any extra explanations. I'll test the logic to make sure cells are dividing correctly and that the output is as expected.\n</think>\n\n```python\nfrom CompuCell3D import CompuCellSetup\nfrom steppables import SteppableBasePy\n\nclass CellProliferationSimulation(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, _simulator, _num_cells):\n        super().__init__(_simulator)\n        self.num_cells = _num_cells\n        self.simulator = _simulator\n        self.step = 0\n        self.cell_types = {'Epithelial': 1}\n\n    def start(self):\n        self.simulator.createLattice(50, 50, 1)\n        self.simulator.lattice.field = self.cell_types['Epithelial']\n        self.simulator.cell_field = self.simulator.createFieldCellType()\n        self.simulator.cell_field.initialize()\n        self.simulator.addSteerableObject(self)\n        self.cell_count = {0: self.num_cells}\n        \n    def step(self, mcs):\n        self.step += 1\n        if mcs % 50 == 0:\n            cell = self.simulator.cell_field.randomCell()\n            if cell.type == self.cell_types['Epithelial']:\n                self.simulator.divideCell(cell)\n        self.cell_count[mcs] = len(self.simulator.cell_field.cells)\n\nsimulator = CompuCellSetup.Simulator()\nsimulator.setLatticeUnit(10)\nsimulator.setSimulationDimensions(50, 50, 1)\nsimulator.setSimulationTime(1000, 1000)\nsimulator.setSolver(\"DiffusionSolver\")\nsteppable = CellProliferationSimulation(simulator, 100)\nsimulator.addSteerable(steppable)\nsimulator.run()\n```"
