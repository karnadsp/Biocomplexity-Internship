    "prompt": "Original description: This paper presents simulations of in vitro Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). The conditions of 2D migration on the surface, and 3D invasion into a collagen gel are represented as a cellular Potts model. The model demonstrates that a loss of endocardial adhesion is a sufficient condition for 2D migration behaviour, while a simultaneous loss of endocardial cohesion and gain in endocardial to collagen gel adhesion is a sufficient condition for 3D invasion. The 3D model captures the hierarchy effective surface tensions that correspond to the three experimental conditions of stable monolayer, 2D migration, and 3D invasion. A 2D cellular Potts model is used to investigate the relationship between cell shape changes, motility and adhesion during the condition of 2D migration.\n\nClarifications provided: \n\n\n    Return ONLY a JSON object with ontology annotations.",

    "response": "<think> \n Okay ,  so  I  need  to  create  a  JSON  object  with  ontology  annotations  based  on  the  provided  paper  description .  The  user  mentioned  including  Cell  Ont ology ,  GO ,  and  Me SH  terms  where  applicable .  Let  me  break  this  down  step  by  step .\n\n First ,  I 'll  read  through  the  original  description  carefully .  The  paper  is  about  simulations  of  Ep ith elial  to  Mes ench ym al  Transition  ( EM T )  in  vitro .  They 're  using  a  cellular  P otts  model  to  represent   2 D  migration  on  a  surface  and   3 D  invasion  into  a  collagen  gel .  The  model  shows  that  losing  end ocard ial  ad hesion  is  enough  for   2 D  migration ,  while  losing  cohesion  and  gaining  ad hesion  to  collagen  allows   3 D  invasion .  There 's  also  a  hierarchy  of  surface  tensions  captured  in  the   3 D  model  corresponding  to  three  experimental  conditions :  stable  mon ol ayer ,   2 D  migration ,  and   3 D  invasion .  Additionally ,  a   2 D  model  looks  at  how  cell  shape  changes  affect  mot ility  and  ad hesion  during   2 D  migration .\n\n Now ,  I  need  to  identify  the  relevant  terms  from  each  ontology .  Let 's  start  with  the  Cell  Ont ology  ( CL ).  The  paper  mentions  E MT ,  which  is  a  process  involving  cells ,  so  I 'll  look  for  terms  related  to  that .  \" Ep ith elial  cell \"  and  \" Mes ench ym al  cell \"  are  directly  relevant .  Since  the  study  is  in  vitro ,  \" in  vitro  cell  model \"  is  appropriate .  They  also  mention  end ocard ial  cells ,  so  \" end ocard ial  cell \"  should  be  included .\n\n Next ,  for  Gene  Ont ology  ( GO ),  I  need  biological  processes  and  maybe  some  molecular  functions .  E MT  is  a  biological  process ,  so  that 's  a  key  term .  Cell  migration  is  a  major  focus ,  both  in   2 D  and   3 D ,  so  \" cell  migration \"  is  essential .  The  model  discusses  ad hesion  and  cohesion ,  so  \" cell  ad hesion \"  and  \" cell  cohesion \"  are  relevant .  Mot ility  is  mentioned ,  so  \" cell  mot ility \"  fits .  Shape  changes  relate  to  \" cell  shape \"  terms .  The   3 D  invasion  into  collagen  gel  ties  into  \" coll agen  gel  invasion .\"  The  cellular  P otts  model  is  a  computational  method ,  so  \" cell ular  model  simulation \"  and  \" comput ational  model \"  are  applicable .  Surface  tension  in  the  context  of  cells  would  be  \" surface  tension  of  cells .\"\n\n Moving  on  to  Me SH  terms ,  which  are  more  about  the  broader  biological  concepts .  E MT  is  a  Me SH  term ,  so  that 's  included .  Cell  migration  is  also  a  Me SH  term .  The  in  vitro  aspect  is  covered  by  \" In  Vit ro  Techniques .\"  The  cellular  P otts  model  falls  under  \" Models ,  Biological .\"  Cell  ad hesion  is  another  Me SH  term .  Since  they 're  studying  processes ,  \" Cell  Movement \"  and  \" Cell  Shape \"  are  relevant .  The   3 D  environment  with  collagen  gel  is  part  of  \" Coll agen \"  and  \" G els .\"\n\n I  should  make  sure  each  category  in  the  JSON  has  all  the  applicable  terms  without  overlapping  too  much .  For  example ,  \" Ep ith elial  to  Mes ench ym al  Transition \"  appears  in  both  CL  and  GO ,  which  makes  sense  because  it 's  a  process  involving  specific  cell  types .  I 'll  structure  the  JSON  with  separate  sections  for  each  ontology ,  listing  the  relevant  terms  as  arrays .\n\n I  also  need  to  ensure  that  I 'm  only  including  terms  that  are  directly  applicable .  For  instance ,  \" cell  shape  changes \"  in  the  description  translates  to  \" cell  shape \"  in  GO .  Similarly ,  \" mot ility \"  is  covered  under  \" cell  mot ility \"  in  GO .  The   3 D  invasion  is  specifically  about  collagen  gel ,  so  that 's  a  distinct  term  in  GO .\n\n I  think  I 've  covered  all  the  necessary  points .  Now ,  I 'll  format  this  into  a  JSON  structure  with  the  three  ontology  categories ,  each  containing  their  respective  terms  as  arrays .\n </think> \n\n ``` json \n {\n    \" Cell  Ont ology \":  [\n      \" Ep ith elial  cell \",\n      \" Mes ench ym al  cell \",\n      \" in  vitro  cell  model \",\n      \" end ocard ial  cell \"\n    ],\n    \" Gene  Ont ology \":  [\n      \" Ep ith elial  to  Mes ench ym al  Transition \",\n      \" cell  migration \",\n      \" cell  ad hesion \",\n      \" cell  cohesion \",\n      \" cell  mot ility \",\n      \" cell  shape \",\n      \" coll agen  gel  invasion \",\n      \" cell ular  model  simulation \",\n      \" comput ational  model \",\n      \" surface  tension  of  cells \"\n    ],\n    \" Me SH \":  [\n      \" Ep ith elial  to  Mes ench ym al  Transition \",\n      \" Cell  Migration \",\n      \" In  Vit ro  Techniques \",\n      \" Models ,  Biological \",\n      \" Cell  Ad hesion \",\n      \" Cell  Movement \",\n      \" Cell  Shape \",\n      \" Coll agen \",\n      \" G els \"\n    ]\n }\n ``` "
