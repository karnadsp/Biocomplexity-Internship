    "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file based on the given ontology annotations. The user provided a Python code example, but I should create my own. Let me break down the requirements.\n\nFirst, the code must include the necessary imports. I remember that CompuCell3D uses modules like CompuCellSetup and steppables. So I'll import CompuCellSetup, which is essential for setting up the simulation. Then, I'll import the specific steppables, probably PySteppable from steppables, as that's where the SteppableBasePy is located.\n\nNext, I need a simulation class that inherits from SteppableBasePy. This class should have __init__, start, and step methods. In the __init__, I'll call the parent's __init__ with the instance and a boolean indicating if it's a steppable. Then, I'll set some parameters like simulation duration, cell cycle duration, and initial number of cells.\n\nIn the start method, I'll set up the simulation. I'll create a lattice, maybe 2D with a certain size. Then, I'll define cell types, perhaps only one type for simplicity. I'll set the initial cell's position, type, and volume. Also, I'll set some parameters like cell cycle duration and proliferation rate.\n\nFor the step method, I'll manage cell division. I'll check if the current step is within the simulation duration. Then, I'll iterate over each cell. For each cell, I'll check if it's ready to divide based on the cell cycle duration. If so, I'll call the divideCell function, which handles the division process. I'll also increment the cell cycle counter for each cell.\n\nI should also include the required parameters and cell types based on the ontology annotations. The cell type is Epithelial, and the processes are cell division and proliferation. So I'll make sure the cell type is correctly defined and the parameters relate to proliferation.\n\nI need to ensure that the code is clean and only includes the necessary parts without any extra text. I'll structure it properly with correct indentation and syntax. Let me put it all together step by step, making sure each part is included as per the requirements.\n</think>\n\n```python\nfrom CompuCell3D import CompuCellSetup\nfrom steppables import PySteppable\n\nclass Simulation(PySteppable):\n    def __init__(self, instance, _):\n        PySteppable.__init__(self, instance)\n        self.instance = instance\n        self.simulation_duration = 1000  # Total simulation steps\n        self.cell_cycle_duration = 100  # Duration of cell cycle\n        self.initial_cells = 1  # Number of initial cells\n\n    def start(self):\n        # Initialize simulation\n        self.cell_field = self.instance.get_cell_field()\n        self.lattice = self.cell_field.lattice\n        self.lattice_size = self.lattice.size\n        self.cell_types = {'Epithelial': 1}\n        self.cell_id = self.cell_types['Epithelial']\n        \n        # Set initial cell\n        self.initial_cell = self.lattice.find_cell_by_type(self.cell_id)\n        if not self.initial_cell:\n            self.initial_cell = self.lattice.create_cell(self.cell_id, self.lattice.size // 2)\n        self.initial_cell.volume = 1\n        self.initial_cell.cell_cycle = 0\n\n        # Set cell parameters\n        self.proliferation_rate = 0.1\n        self.cell_cycle_duration = 100\n\n    def step(self, mcs):\n        if mcs >= self.simulation_duration:\n            return\n\n        # Update cell cycle\n        for cell in self.cell_field.cells:\n            if cell.type == self.cell_id:\n                cell.cell_cycle += 1\n                if cell.cell_cycle >= self.cell_cycle_duration:\n                    self.divide_cell(cell)\n\n    def divide_cell(self, cell):\n        # Check if cell can divide\n        if cell.volume > 1:\n            # Divide the cell\n            self.lattice.create_cell_in_neighbor_position(cell, cell.position)\n            cell.volume = 1\n            cell.cell_cycle = 0\n\nCompuCellSetup.simulation = Simulation(CompuCellSetup.instance, None)\n```"
