        "description": "We use the Glazier-Graner-Hogeweg model to simulate three-dimensional (3D), single-phenotype, avascular tumors growing in an homogeneous tissue matrix (TM) supplying a single limiting nutrient. We study the effects of two parameters on tumor morphology: a diffusion-limitation parameter defined as the ratio of the tumor-substrate consumption rate to the substrate-transport rate, and the tumor-TM surface tension. This initial model omits necrosis and oxidative/hypoxic metabolism effects, which can further influence tumor morphology, but our simplified model still shows significant parameter dependencies. The diffusion-limitation parameter determines whether the growing solid tumor develops a smooth (noninvasive) or fingered (invasive) interface, as in our earlier two-dimensional (2D) simulations. The sensitivity of 3D tumor morphology to tumor-TM surface tension increases with the size of the diffusion-limitation parameter, as in 2D. The 3D results are unexpectedly close to those in 2D. Our results therefore may justify using simpler 2D simulations of tumor growth, instead of more realistic but more computationally expensive 3D simulations. While geometrical artifacts mean that 2D sections of connected 3D tumors may be disconnected, the morphologies of 3D simulated tumors nevertheless correlate with the morphologies of their 2D sections, especially for low-surface-tension tumors, allowing the use of 2D sections to partially reconstruct medically-important 3D-tumor structures."

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants ontology annotations based on the provided information. They mentioned the Glazier-Graner-Hogeweg model for simulating 3D tumors. First, I need to identify relevant terms from Cell Ontology, Gene Ontology, and MeSH.\n\nStarting with CellOntology: The model is about avascular tumors. Avascular tumor cells might be a relevant term. Checking Cell Ontology, \"CL:0000000\" is a placeholder, but maybe \"CL:0001063\" for neoplastic cells? Wait, the example uses \"Epithelial\" with CL:0000000, but I need actual terms. Alternatively, maybe \"Tumor Cell\" as CL:0001063. But I should verify. However, the example uses \"Epithelial\" with CL:0000000, but the actual CL ID for epithelial cell is CL:0000066. Wait, but the original description mentions single-phenotype tumors. Maybe \"neoplastic cell\" is CL:0001063. Let me check. CL:0001063 is indeed \"neoplastic cell\". So that's a candidate.\n\nGeneOntology: The model involves cell proliferation, growth, and substrate transport. Processes like \"cell proliferation\" (GO:0008283), \"nutrient transport\" (GO:0006810), and \"multicellular organism growth\" (GO:0035264). Also, since it's a simulation model, maybe \"in silico cell population model\" (GO:0098595). That might fit under GeneOntology.\n\nMeSH terms: Topics include tumor growth (D018343), computer simulation (D003198), biological models (D001694), cell proliferation (D049710), and diffusion (D004065). Also, \"tumor microenvironment\" (D059016) might be relevant since they talk about tissue matrix and nutrient supply. Surface tension is a physical concept, but under MeSH, maybe \"Surface Properties\" (D013492). \n\nWait, the original text mentions \"homogeneous tissue matrix\" supplying a nutrient, so \"Extracellular Matrix\" (D005109) could be another MeSH term. Also, \"Neoplasms\" (D009369) as a general term. \n\nPutting it all together. Need to ensure IDs are correct and terms are exact. Let me cross-verify:\n\nCellOntology: Neoplastic Cell is CL:0001063. That's correct.\n\nGeneOntology: Cell proliferation is GO:0008283. Nutrient transport is GO:0006810 (but that's for ion transport, maybe \"organic substance transport\" GO:0015850?). Wait, the model mentions substrate consumption, so maybe \"substrate transport\" isn't a GO term. Alternatively, \"response to nutrient levels\" GO:0031667. Hmm. Maybe \"multicellular organism growth\" (GO:0035264) is better. Also, \"in silico simulation\" could be GO:1904131 (cellular component simulation), but not sure. Alternatively, \"cell population proliferation\" (GO:0008283) which is cell proliferation. Wait, the example uses \"Cell Division\" as GO:0000000, but the correct ID for cell proliferation is GO:0008283. So, cell proliferation is appropriate here.\n\nMeSH: Tumor growth (D018343), Computer Simulation (D003198), Models, Biological (D008954) (but the example uses D000000 for cell proliferation, but actual MeSH for biological models is D001694. Wait, MeSH term for Biological Models is D001694. Computer Simulation is D003198. Neoplasms is D009369. Extracellular Matrix is D005109. Surface tension under MeSH is D013492 (Surface Properties). Cell Proliferation in MeSH is D049710. Diffusion is D004065. So those terms fit.\n\nNow, need to format exactly as per instructions. No extra spaces, correct IDs. Let's list them.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0001063\",\n            \"term\": \"Neoplastic Cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0008283\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Proliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0035264\",\n            \"term\": \"Multicellular Organism Growth\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0040007\",\n            \"term\": \"Growth\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D009369\",\n            \"term\": \"Neoplasms\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D003198\",\n            \"term\": \"Computer Simulation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D001694\",\n            \"term\": \"Biological Models\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D005109\",\n            \"term\": \"Extracellular Matrix\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D013492\",\n            \"term\": \"Surface Properties\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"
