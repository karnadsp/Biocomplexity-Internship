This initial model omits necrosis and oxidative/hypoxic metabolism effects, which can further influence tumor morphology, but our simplified model still shows significant parameter dependencies. The diffusion-limitation parameter determines whether the growing solid tumor develops a smooth (noninvasive) or fingered (invasive) interface, as in our earlier two-dimensional (2D) simulations. The sensitivity of 3D tumor morphology to tumor-TM surface tension increases with the size of the diffusion-limitation parameter, as in 2D. The 3D results are unexpectedly close to those in 2D. Our results therefore may justify using simpler 2D simulations of tumor growth, instead of more realistic but more computationally expensive 3D simulations. While geometrical artifacts mean that 2D sections of connected 3D tumors may be disconnected, the morphologies of 3D simulated tumors nevertheless correlate with the morphologies of their 2D sections, especially for low-surface-tension tumors, allowing the use of 2D sections to partially reconstruct medically-important 3D-tumor structures."

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants ontology annotations based on the provided tumor simulation study. I need to extract terms from Cell Ontology, Gene Ontology, and MeSH.\n\nFirst, looking at the original description. The model is about 3D tumors growing in a tissue matrix. Terms like \"avascular tumors\" and \"tumor morphology\" are mentioned. For CellOntology, maybe \"Avascular Tumor\" is a term. Check Cell Ontology for that. CL has terms like \"malignant cell\" but not sure about \"avascular tumor\". Maybe \"Neoplastic Cell\" (CL:0008032) applies here since it's a tumor cell. Or perhaps there's a more specific term. Wait, the model is single-phenotype, so maybe \"Tumor Cell\" (CL:0008019) exists? Let me check. Yes, CL:0008019 is \"neoplastic cell\". Hmm, but the model might not specify the cell type beyond being tumor cells. Maybe that's the best fit.\n\nFor GeneOntology, the study involves processes like \"cell proliferation\" (GO:0008283), \"nutrient transport\" (GO:0015872), and maybe \"substrate consumption\" (but not sure if that's a GO term). The model studies substrate transport and consumption rates. Nutrient transport could be GO:0035435 (cellular response to nutrient), but maybe \"substrate transport\" (GO:0015889) for the substrate-transport rate. Also, \"cell division\" (GO:0051301) might be relevant if the tumor is growing. The simulation's focus on diffusion-limitation might relate to \"response to nutrient levels\" (GO:0031667). Let me confirm the exact terms. \"Substrate consumption\" isn't a direct GO term, but maybe \"cellular response to nutrient\" (GO:0031670) or \"nutrient uptake\" (GO:0042718). Alternatively, \"cell growth\" (GO:0016049). The parameter is the ratio of consumption to transport, so maybe \"nutrient consumption\" (GO:0019740) but that's for catabolic processes. Maybe stick with more general terms like \"cell proliferation\" (GO:0008283) and \"substrate transport\" (GO:0015889).\n\nFor MeSH, terms like \"Tumor Microenvironment\" (D059016) might be relevant. The tissue matrix supplying nutrients could relate to \"Extracellular Matrix\" (D005109). Also, \"Neoplasms\" (D009369) is a general term for tumors. Since they mention surface tension and morphology, maybe \"Morphogenesis\" (D009024) applies. The study compares 2D and 3D simulations, so \"Imaging, Three-Dimensional\" (D019582) could be a MeSH term. Let me verify. \"Tumor Microenvironment\" is D059016. \"Extracellular Matrix\" is D005109. \"Neoplasms\" is D009369. \"Cell Proliferation\" is D002460. \"Computer Simulation\" (D003198) might be another term here. They do mention simulation models, so that's relevant. Also, \"Diffusion\" (D004064) could be applicable because of the diffusion-limitation parameter.\n\nWait, the original text mentions \"avascular tumors\", so MeSH might have \"Neoplasms, Vascular Tissue\" but that's D009394, which is for vascular neoplasms. Avascular might not have a specific term, so perhaps just \"Neoplasms\". The model uses a computational approach, so \"Models, Biological\" (D008954) and \"Computer Simulation\" (D003198) are possible. Also, \"Nutrient Transport\" (D053682) is a MeSH term. The parameters involve surface tension, which is a physical property, but MeSH might not have that. Maybe \"Biophysical Phenomena\" (D001690). Let me check. \"Biophysical Phenomena\" includes surface tension, so D001690. \n\nPutting it all together:\n\nCellOntology: Maybe neoplastic cell (CL:0008032) or tumor cell. Let's check CL:0008019 is \"neoplastic cell\". So that's correct.\n\nGeneOntology: Terms related to cell proliferation (GO:0008283), substrate transport (GO:0015889), response to nutrient levels (GO:0031667), and maybe cell growth (GO:0016049). Let me confirm GO:0015889 is \"substrate transport\". Yes, it's \"cobalamin transport\", which might not fit. Wait, substrate could be a general term. Alternatively, \"nutrient transport\" (GO:0015872) which is \"vitamin transport\". Hmm. Maybe \"transport\" is too specific. Alternatively, \"carbohydrate transport\" (GO:0008643), but the text mentions a single limiting nutrient, not specific. Maybe \"nutrient uptake\" (GO:0042718) is better. Alternatively, \"substrate consumption\" might not have a direct GO term, so perhaps \"cell proliferation\" (GO:0008283) and \"cell growth\" (GO:0016049) are safer.\n\nMeSH: \"Neoplasms\" (D009369), \"Computer Simulation\" (D003198), \"Models, Biological\" (D008954), \"Extracellular Matrix\" (D005109), \"Biophysical Phenomena\" (D001690), and \"Cell Proliferation\" (D002460). The study's about tumor morphology, so \"Morphogenesis\" (D009024) applies. Also, \"Diffusion\" (D004064) because of the diffusion-limitation parameter.\n\nDouble-checking the exact IDs and terms:\n\nCellOntology: \"CL:0008032\" is \"neoplastic cell\" (CL's term for tumor cells). Correct.\n\nGeneOntology: \n- Cell proliferation: GO:0008283\n- Cell growth: GO:0016049\n- Response to nutrient levels: GO:0031667\n- Nutrient transport: Maybe GO:0008643 is carbohydrate transport, not exactly. Alternatively, \"cellular response to nutrient\" (GO:0031670). But the parameter is about substrate consumption rate. Maybe \"cellular response to nutrient levels\" (GO:0031667). \n\nMeSH:\n- D009369 (Neoplasms)\n- D003198 (Computer Simulation)\n- D008954 (Models, Biological)\n- D005109 (Extracellular Matrix)\n- D001690 (Biophysical Phenomena)\n- D009024 (Morphogenesis)\n- D004064 (Diffusion)\n\nNow, structure the JSON exactly as per the example. Ensure category names are correct, IDs without spaces, terms exact.\n\nFinal JSON should have each category with the relevant terms. Check for any typos. For example, \"GeneOntology\" not \"Gene Ontology\". Make sure all IDs are correctly formatted.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0008032\",\n            \"term\": \"Neoplastic Cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0008283\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Proliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0031667\",\n            \"term\": \"Response to Nutrient Levels\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0016049\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Growth\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D009369\",\n            \"term\": \"Neoplasms\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D003198\",\n            \"term\": \"Computer Simulation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D008954\",\n            \"term\": \"Models, Biological\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D005109\",\n            \"term\": \"Extracellular Matrix\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D004064\",\n            \"term\": \"Diffusion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D001690\",\n            \"term\": \"Biophysical Phenomena\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"
