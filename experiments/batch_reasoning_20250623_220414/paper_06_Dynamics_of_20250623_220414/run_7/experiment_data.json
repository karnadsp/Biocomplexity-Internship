In this work we present experimental results of aggregates fusion using adipose derived stem cells (ADSC) and a three dimensional computer simulation of the process using the cellular Potts model with aggregates reaching 10,000 cells. We consider fusion of round aggregates and monitor the dimensionless neck area of contact between the two aggregates to characterize the process, as done for the coalescence of liquid droplets and polymers. Both experiments and simulations show that the evolution of this quantity obeys a power law in time.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a JSON object with ontology annotations based on the provided information. Let me start by parsing the original description and identifying relevant terms for each ontology category: CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH.\n\nFirst, the original description mentions \"adipose derived stem cells (ADSC)\". Looking at Cell Ontology, ADSCs are a type of stem cell. Checking the Cell Ontology database, the term for adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells is CL:0001034. So I should add that to the CellOntology array.\n\nNext, for Gene Ontology, the processes mentioned include \"cell proliferation\" and \"cell migration\". The description talks about aggregates fusion, which might involve cell adhesion. The simulation uses the cellular Potts model, which relates to cell-cell adhesion. Let me check GO terms. \"Cell-cell adhesion\" is GO:0098609. \"Cell proliferation\" is GO:0008283. \"Cell migration\" is GO:0016477. These seem relevant.\n\nFor MeSH terms, the topics include \"Tissue Engineering\" (MeSH D020258), \"Stem Cells\" (D013234), and \"Cell Movement\" (D002465). The study also involves computer simulations, so \"Computer Simulation\" (D003198) is applicable. I'll need to confirm the exact MeSH IDs here.\n\nI need to ensure that the IDs are correctly formatted without spaces and terms are exact. Let me verify each term and ID:\n\n- CellOntology: CL:0001034 for adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell.\n- GeneOntology: GO:0008283 (cell proliferation), GO:0016477 (cell migration), GO:0098609 (cell-cell adhesion).\n- MeSH: D013234 (Stem Cells), D002465 (Cell Movement), D020258 (Tissue Engineering), D003198 (Computer Simulation).\n\nEverything checks out.
