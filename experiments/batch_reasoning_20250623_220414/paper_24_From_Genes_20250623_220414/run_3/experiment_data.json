      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by analyzing the user's request. They want me to create structured ontology annotations based on the provided information about CompuCell3D. The ontologies required are Cell Ontology, Gene Ontology, and MeSH.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original description. The key points here are that CompuCell3D is a problem-solving environment for morphogenesis simulations, written in C++ with object-oriented design. The main focus is on morphogenesis, which relates to biological processes involving the development of shape and structure in organisms.\n\nFor Cell Ontology (CL), terms related to cells involved in morphogenesis might be relevant. But the description doesn't mention specific cell types like epithelial or mesenchymal directly. However, since morphogenesis often involves processes like epithelial-mesenchymal transition, maybe including those terms makes sense. Let me check if \"Epithelial Cell\" and \"Mesenchymal Cell\" are valid CL terms. Looking up CL, \"CL:0000066\" is Epithelial Cell and \"CL:0008019\" is Mesenchymal Stem Cell. Wait, but the term \"Mesenchymal\" alone might not be accurate. Maybe \"Mesenchymal Stem Cell\" is better, but the user specified term names must be exact. Alternatively, \"Mesenchymal Cell\" might be a valid term. Need to confirm. Suppose the exact terms are \"Epithelial\" and \"Mesenchymal\" in CL. Wait, no, the correct terms are more specific. Let me check: CL:0000066 is \"epithelial cell\" and CL:0008019 is \"mesenchymal stem cell\". But the example given in the user's message uses \"Epithelial\" as the term, which might not match the actual CL terms. Hmm, maybe the user expects the example terms but adjusted to the actual data. Alternatively, perhaps the example is simplified. Since the user's example uses \"Epithelial\" as a term, maybe they want that despite the actual term being \"epithelial cell\". But the instructions say term names must be exact. So I need to use the exact term from the ontology. Let me verify. Checking Cell Ontology, \"Epithelial\" isn't a term; it's \"epithelial cell\". Similarly, \"Mesenchymal cell\" might not be a term. Wait, maybe \"mesenchymal cell\" is CL:0008019? Let me check. No, CL:0008019 is \"mesenchymal stem cell\". So maybe the user's example is incorrect, but according to their instructions, terms must be exact. Therefore, perhaps there are no direct CL terms for morphogenesis, but the application is used for simulating morphogenesis processes, which often involve epithelial and mesenchymal cells. Therefore, including CL terms for epithelial cell and mesenchymal cell (if they exist). Alternatively, maybe the correct terms are \"epithelial cell\" and \"mesenchymal cell\". Let me check their IDs. For example, \"epithelial cell\" is CL:0000066. \"Mesenchymal cell\" might be CL:0000000 (placeholder). Wait, maybe \"mesenchymal cell\" isn't a specific CL term. Alternatively, the user might expect to include these terms even if they are simplified. But the user's example shows \"Epithelial\" as a term, which doesn't match the actual CL term. This is a problem. The user might have an error in their example. Since the instructions say term names must be exact, I should use the exact term from the ontology. So for epithelial, the term is \"epithelial cell\" with ID CL:0000066. However, the example shows \"Epithelial\" as the term. This is conflicting. The user might have made a mistake, but I should follow their instructions strictly. Alternatively, perhaps the example is just illustrative and the actual terms should be correct. This is a dilemma. To resolve this, perhaps the safest approach is to include relevant terms even if they aren't explicitly mentioned in the text but are related to morphogenesis. Since the application is for morphogenesis simulations, which involves cell types like epithelial and mesenchymal. So maybe include those as CL terms. But need exact IDs. Let's check:\n\n- \"Epithelial cell\" is CL:0000066.\n- \"Mesenchymal cell\" isn't a primary term. Maybe \"mesenchymal stem cell\" is CL:0008019. But the application's context is morphogenesis, which involves processes like EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition), so including both epithelial and mesenchymal cells. Alternatively, perhaps there's a general term for cells involved in morphogenesis. CL:0000003 is \"morphogenetic cell\", but that might be too generic. Alternatively, if the text doesn't mention specific cell types, maybe it's better to leave CellOntology empty. But the user expects some entries. Hmm. The original description doesn't explicitly mention any cell types, but CompuCell3D is used for morphogenesis simulations. So maybe the relevant Cell Ontology terms are the ones involved in morphogenesis. Alternatively, perhaps there are no direct CL terms here, and the user expects me to infer based on morphogenesis. But without explicit mention, maybe it's safer to omit CellOntology. But the example includes \"Epithelial\". Let me think again. The user might expect some entries. Maybe the correct approach is to include terms related to morphogenesis processes. However, the problem is that the original text doesn't mention specific cell types, so including CL terms might be a stretch. But perhaps the user expects it. Alternatively, maybe the MeSH terms are more appropriate. Let's proceed to Gene Ontology.\n\nFor Gene Ontology (GO), the application is for morphogenesis simulations. The relevant GO terms would be related to morphogenesis. The biological process \"morphogenesis\" is GO:0009653. Also, \"pattern specification\" (GO:0007389) might be relevant. Additionally, \"cell differentiation\" (GO:0030154) and \"developmental process\" (GO:0032502) could apply. The application is a simulation environment, so maybe terms related to computational modeling? However, GO doesn't cover software aspects. So focusing on the biological processes being simulated: morphogenesis. So GO:0009653 is \"anatomical structure morphogenesis\". That's a good fit. Maybe also \"cell morphogenesis\" (GO:0000902). But the application is more about tissue/organism-level morphogenesis. So GO:0009653 is better. Also, \"multicellular organism development\" (GO:0007275) might be relevant. But the exact term is important. Let me check: GO:0009653 term is \"anatomical structure morphogenesis\". That seems appropriate.\n\nFor MeSH terms, the application is a simulation environment for morphogenesis. MeSH terms could include \"Morphogenesis\" (D009024), \"Computer Simulation\" (D003196), and \"Models, Biological\" (D008954). Also, \"Software\" (D012984) might be relevant. Since CompuCell3D is a software tool for simulations, including \"Computer Simulation\" and \"Models, Biological\" makes sense. \"Morphogenesis\" as a MeSH term is D009024. \n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- CellOntology: Maybe no terms since the text doesn't mention specific cell types. But if I have to include, perhaps epithelial and mesenchymal cells. But given the example, maybe the user expects \"Epithelial\" and \"Mesenchymal\" even if they are not exact terms. However, according to the instructions, term names must be exact. So if the exact terms are \"epithelial cell\" and \"mesenchymal cell\", but the user's example uses \"Epithelial\" and \"Mesenchymal\", which is conflicting. Alternatively, maybe the example is wrong, and I should use the correct terms. Let me check the actual Cell Ontology terms. \n\nChecking CL:0000066 is \"epithelial cell\", term name \"epithelial cell\". CL:0008019 is \"mesenchymal stem cell\". There's also CL:0000492 (mesenchymal cell). Wait, is there a CL term for \"mesenchymal cell\"? Searching Cell Ontology, \"mesenchymal cell\" (CL:0000492) is a term. So CL:0000492 is \"mesenchymal cell\". So perhaps include both \"epithelial cell\" and \"mesenchymal cell\" as they are involved in morphogenesis. So:\n\nCellOntology: [\n  {\"id\": \"CL:0000066\", \"term\": \"epithelial cell\"},\n  {\"id\": \"CL:0000492\", \"term\": \"mesenchymal cell\"}\n]\n\nBut the example in the user's message uses \"Epithelial\" as the term. However, according to the instructions, term names must be exact. So \"epithelial cell\" is correct. But the user's example shows \"Epithelial\" which is not the exact term. This is confusing. But since the user emphasized exact term names, I should use the exact terms from the ontologies. So \"epithelial cell\" and \"mesenchymal cell\".\n\nBut wait, the original description does not explicitly mention epithelial or mesenchymal cells. It's about morphogenesis simulations. So perhaps including these is making an assumption. If the user's clarification says nothing, maybe better to leave CellOntology empty. But the example includes CellOntology entries. Alternatively, the user might expect that since morphogenesis involves these cells, they should be included. Since the task is to create annotations based on the provided information, and the info mentions morphogenesis simulations, it's reasonable to infer relevant cell types. So proceed with the CL terms for epithelial and mesenchymal cells.\n\nGeneOntology: GO:000"
