      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to create a JSON object with ontology annotations based on the provided information. The input is a description of CompuCell3D, a software for morphogenesis simulations. \n\nFirst, I need to identify relevant terms from the description. The main points here are \"morphogenesis simulations,\" \"object-oriented design patterns,\" \"C++,\" \"scientific applications,\" and \"problem-solving environment.\" \n\nStarting with Cell Ontology (CL). Morphogenesis involves cells, so maybe terms related to epithelial or mesenchymal cells, but the description doesn't specify particular cell types. Since the example used \"Epithelial,\" but the input text doesn't mention specific cells, maybe there's no relevant CL term here. I'll check Cell Ontology for terms related to morphogenesis. Hmm, maybe \"CL:0000003\" for somatic cell, but not sure. Wait, maybe there's no direct cell type mentioned. The text is about a simulation tool, not a specific cell. So perhaps CellOntology should be empty.\n\nNext, Gene Ontology (GO). The software is for morphogenesis simulations. Morphogenesis is a biological process, so GO terms like \"morphogenesis\" (GO:0009653) and \"pattern specification\" (GO:0007389) might apply. Also, \"simulation\" itself isn't a GO term, but the application's purpose relates to these processes. So include those GO IDs.\n\nFor MeSH, the terms could be related to computational biology methods. MeSH has \"Software\" (D012984), \"Computer Simulation\" (D003198), and \"Morphogenesis\" (D009024). Also, \"Problem Solving\" (D011335) might fit the problem-solving environment. \"Object-Oriented Programming\" (D015990) is another MeSH term relevant here since it's built using object-oriented design in C++.\n\nCheck the IDs: GO:0009653 is indeed morphogenesis, GO:0007389 is pattern specification. For MeSH, D012984 is Software, D003198 is Computer Simulation, D009024 is Morphogenesis, D011335 is Problem Solving, and D015990 is Object-Oriented Programming. \n\nEnsure the category names are exact: \"CellOntology\", \"GeneOntology\", \"MeSH\". Since there's no specific cell type mentioned, leave CellOntology empty. The terms and IDs must be exact without extra spaces. \n\nSo the final JSON should have GeneOntology with morphogenesis and pattern specification, MeSH with the terms I listed, and CellOntology as an empty array. Let me structure that.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0009653\",\n            \"term\": \"Morphogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007389\",\n            \"term\": \"Pattern Specification\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D012984\",\n            \"term\": \"Software\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D003198\",\n            \"term\": \"Computer Simulation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D009024\",\n            \"term\": \"Morphogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D011335\",\n            \"term\": \"Problem Solving\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D015990\",\n            \"term\": \"Object-Oriented Programming\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```"
