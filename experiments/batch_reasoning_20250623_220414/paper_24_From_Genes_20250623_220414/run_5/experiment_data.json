      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to create ontology annotations based on the provided information. The example given is about CompuCell3D, a tool for morphogenesis simulations.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original description. It mentions morphogenesis simulations, which relates to biological processes. The relevant ontologies are Cell Ontology (CL), Gene Ontology (GO), and MeSH. \n\nLooking at CellOntology: terms related to morphogenesis might include specific cell types involved. But the description doesn't specify particular cell types like epithelial or mesenchymal. Hmm, maybe \"Stem Cell\" since morphogenesis often involves stem cells, but I'm not sure. Wait, the example in the prompt used \"Epithelial\" and \"Mesenchymal\". But if the original text doesn't mention specific cells, maybe I shouldn't include those. Maybe there's a general term in CL for cells involved in morphogenesis. Let me check CL terms. CL has terms like \"somatic cell\" (CL:0000003) or \"animal cell\" (CL:0000000), but those might be too generic. Alternatively, maybe \"cell involved in morphogenesis\" exists. Wait, perhaps \"motile cell\" (CL:0000219) if movement is part of morphogenesis. But the text doesn't specify. Maybe the CellOntology section should be left empty if there's no specific cell mentioned.\n\nGeneOntology: Morphogenesis is a biological process. GO has \"morphogenesis\" (GO:0009653) as a term. Also, the tool is for simulation, so maybe \"computational modeling\" (GO:0086016) or \"simulation of biological process\" (GO:0042572). Let me check. GO:0009653 is anatomical structure morphogenesis. GO:0042572 is obsolete, so maybe not. Alternatively, \"biological process involved in interspecies interaction between organisms\" (GO:0044419) but that's not relevant. Wait, the tool is for simulation, so perhaps \"model organism experimental simulation\" (GO:0086016) is a better fit. But I need to verify the exact IDs. GO:0086016 is \"model organism experimental simulation\". Alternatively, \"simulation of biological process\" might be a different term. Alternatively, \"developmental process\" (GO:0032502). Hmm. Since the main focus is morphogenesis, GO:0009653 is the key term here. Maybe also \"pattern specification process\" (GO:0007389) if applicable. But the original text doesn't go into specifics beyond morphogenesis simulations. So probably just GO:0009653.\n\nMeSH terms: Looking for terms related to computational modeling, morphogenesis, simulations. MeSH terms like \"Morphogenesis\" (D009024), \"Computer Simulation\" (D003198), \"Models, Biological\" (D008954). Those seem relevant. The tool is a problem-solving environment for simulations, so \"Computer Simulation\" (D003198) and \"Models, Biological\" (D008954) are appropriate. Also, \"Morphogenesis\" (D009024) directly relates.\n\nPutting it all together. The CellOntology might not have specific terms unless the example suggests including epithelial and mesenchymal, but the original text doesn't mention those. So maybe leave CellOntology empty. But wait, the example includes \"Epithelial\" with CL:0000000. But the original text here doesn't mention epithelial cells. So perhaps the user wants us to infer based on morphogenesis. But without explicit mention, maybe better to omit. So CellOntology could be empty. GeneOntology would have GO:0009653 (morphogenesis). MeSH would have D009024 (Morphogenesis), D003198 (Computer Simulation), and D008954 (Models, Biological). Wait, but the original text is about building the tool in C++ with object-oriented design. But the MeSH terms should relate to the application's purpose, which is morphogenesis simulations. So the MeSH terms I listed make sense. Let me check exact MeSH IDs: \"Morphogenesis\" is D009024, \"Computer Simulation\" is D003198, \"Models, Biological\" is D008954. Correct.\n\nSo the final JSON would have GeneOntology with morphogenesis (GO:0009653), MeSH with those three terms, and CellOntology empty? Wait, but the example in the prompt included CellOntology entries. However, the original description here doesn't mention specific cell types. Therefore, maybe CellOntology should be empty. Alternatively, if the tool is used for simulating epithelial-mesenchymal transitions, but the text doesn't specify. The original description only mentions morphogenesis simulations in general. So perhaps no CellOntology terms. Let me confirm. The original description says \"morphogenesis simulations\" but doesn't specify cell types. Therefore, CellOntology remains empty. \n\nSo the JSON would be:\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0009653\",\n            \"term\": \"morphogenesis\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D009024\",\n            \"term\": \"Morphogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D003198\",\n            \"term\": \"Computer Simulation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D008954\",\n            \"term\": \"Models, Biological\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWait, the term names must be exact. For GeneOntology, \"morphogenesis\" is correct as per GO:0009653's term name. For MeSH, \"Morphogenesis\" is the correct term (capitalized?), \"Computer Simulation\" and \"Models, Biological\" (note the comma and space). MeSH term for \"Computer Simulation\" is exactly that. \"Models, Biological\" is the correct term. Yes.\n\nSo that should be the correct structure.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0009653\",\n            \"term\": \"morphogenesis\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D009024\",\n            \"term\": \"Morphogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D003198\",\n            \"term\": \"Computer Simulation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D008954\",\n            \"term\": \"Models, Biological\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```"
