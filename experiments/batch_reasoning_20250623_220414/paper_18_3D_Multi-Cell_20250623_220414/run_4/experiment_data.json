Initially, tumor cells proliferate as they take up the oxygen which the pre-existing vasculature supplies. The tumor grows exponentially. When the oxygen level drops below a threshold, the tumor cells become hypoxic and start secreting pro-angiogenic factors. At this stage, the tumor reaches a maximum diameter characteristic of an avascular tumor spheroid. The endothelial cells in the pre-existing vasculature respond to the pro-angiogenic factors both by chemotaxing towards higher concentrations of pro-angiogenic factors and by forming new blood vessels via angiogenesis. The tumor-induced vasculature increases the growth rate of the resulting vascularized solid tumor compared to an avascular tumor, allowing the tumor to grow beyond the spheroid in these lineargrowth phases. First, in the linear-spherical phase of growth, the tumor remains spherical while its volume increases. Second, in the linear-cylindrical phase of growth the tumor elongates into a cylinder. Finally, in the linear-sheet phase of growth, tumor growth accelerates as the tumor changes from cylindrical to paddle-shaped. Substantial periods during which the tumor grows slowly or not at all separate the exponential from the linear-spherical and the linear-spherical from the linear-cylindrical growth phases. In contrast to other simulations in which avascular tumors remain spherical, our simulated avascular tumors form cylinders following the blood vessels, leading to a different distribution of hypoxic cells within the tumor. Our simulations cover time periods which are long enough to produce a range of biologically reasonable complex morphologies, allowing us to study how tumor-induced angiogenesis affects the growth rate, size and morphology of simulated tumors."

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me start by breaking down the problem. The user wants me to create structured ontology annotations based on the provided description of a 3D vascular tumor growth simulation. The ontologies needed are CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH. I need to make sure the category names are exact, the IDs are correctly formatted without spaces, and the terms are precise.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the original description to identify relevant biological concepts. The main elements mentioned are tumor cells, endothelial cells, hypoxic cells, angiogenesis, cell proliferation, chemotaxis, etc. \n\nFor CellOntology, possible terms could be \"Endothelial Cell\" (CL:0000115), \"Tumor Cell\" (CL:0001064), and maybe \"Hypoxic Cell\" (CL:0001065). Wait, I need to check if \"Hypoxic Cell\" is an actual Cell Ontology term. Let me verify that. Hmm, Cell Ontology does have CL:0001064 for neoplastic cell, which is a tumor cell. Hypoxic cells might not have a specific CL ID, so maybe that's not applicable. The text mentions hypoxic tumor cells, but perhaps the closest is just Tumor Cell. Alternatively, if there's a term for hypoxic cell, but I'm not sure. Maybe better to stick with Endothelial and Tumor cells here.\n\nNext, GeneOntology. The processes mentioned include angiogenesis (GO:0001525), cell proliferation (GO:0008283), chemotaxis (GO:0006935), and response to oxygen levels (GO:0070482). Also, secretion of pro-angiogenic factors might be under 'secretion by cell' (GO:0032940) or something more specific. Let me check the exact terms. Angiogenesis is definitely GO:0001525. Cell proliferation is GO:0008283. Chemotaxis is GO:0006935. Response to hypoxia is GO:0001666. The description mentions response to pro-angiogenic factors, so maybe 'response to growth factor' (GO:0070848) or 'cellular response to chemical stimulus' (GO:0070887). Alternatively, since they secrete the factors, 'secretion' (GO:0046903) could apply. Let me confirm. The text says \"secreting pro-angiogenic factors\" so maybe 'secretion' (GO:0046903) or 'regulation of angiogenesis' (GO:0045765). But the exact term for secretion by cell might be 'secretory process' (GO:0046903). Also, the endothelial cells respond by chemotaxing and forming new vessels, which is angiogenesis. So the GO terms here would include angiogenesis, cell proliferation, chemotaxis, and response to hypoxia.\n\nFor MeSH terms, relevant concepts are Tumor Growth (D018303), Neovascularization, Pathologic (D018909) which is pathological angiogenesis, Hypoxia (D000860), Chemotaxis (D002648), and maybe Cell Proliferation (D049109). Let me check the MeSH IDs. Tumor Growth is D018303. Neovascularization, Pathologic is D018909. Hypoxia is D000860. Chemotaxis is D002648. Cell Proliferation is D049109. Those seem correct.\n\nPutting it all together, the CellOntology would include Endothelial Cell (CL:0000115) and Tumor Cell (CL:0001064). GeneOntology would have terms like angiogenesis, cell proliferation, chemotaxis, response to hypoxia. MeSH would include Tumor Growth, Neovascularization, Pathologic, Hypoxia, Chemotaxis, and Cell Proliferation.\n\nWait, need to ensure that each term's ID is correct. For example, response to hypoxia in GO is GO:0001666. Yes. And secretion might be another term if applicable. The text mentions secretion of pro-angiogenic factors, so 'secretion' (GO:0046903) is a possible term. But maybe 'secretion by cell' (GO:0032940)? Let me check. GO:0046903 is 'exocytosis', which is a type of secretion. Alternatively, 'regulation of angiogenesis' (GO:0045765) could be included since the cells secrete factors that promote angiogenesis. So perhaps adding GO:0045765 as well. But the exact term for the secretion process is important. If the description is about secreting the factors, then exocytosis (GO:0046903) or 'secretion' (GO:0046903) would apply. Alternatively, 'cytokine secretion' (GO:0050667) if pro-angiogenic factors are cytokines. But the exact term might be 'secretion' (GO:0046903). Let me confirm: GO:0046903 is 'exocytosis', which is the process of secreting substances. So maybe that's the term. Alternatively, 'secretion by cell' is GO:0032940. Wait, GO:0032940 is 'regulation of secretion by cell', which might not be the exact term. Hmm. The exact process here is the secretion itself. The text says \"start secreting pro-angiogenic factors\", so the actual secretion process. The GO term for 'secretion' would be GO:0046903 (exocytosis) or perhaps 'protein secretion' (GO:0032944) if the factors are proteins. Since pro-angiogenic factors like VEGF are proteins, maybe GO:0032944. But I need to check if that's accurate. Alternatively, 'secretion' as a parent term. However, to avoid overcomplicating, maybe stick with the broader terms mentioned earlier: angiogenesis, cell proliferation, chemotaxis, response to hypoxia.\n\nSo GeneOntology entries would be:\n- Angiogenesis (GO:0001525)\n- Cell proliferation (GO:0008283)\n- Chemotaxis (GO:0006935)\n- Response to hypoxia (GO:0001666)\n\nMeSH terms:\n- Tumor Growth (D018303)\n- Neovascularization, Pathologic (D018909)\n- Hypoxia (D000860)\n- Chemotaxis (D002648)\n- Cell Proliferation (D049109)\n\nWait, but the MeSH term for Cell Proliferation is D049109. Let me verify. Yes, MeSH D049109 is Cell Proliferation. Correct.\n\nCellOntology:\n- Endothelial Cell (CL:0000115)\n- Tumor Cell (CL:0001064)\n\nI think that's it. Now, need to structure them into the JSON format as specified, ensuring no extra spaces and exact category names.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000115\",\n            \"term\": \"Endothelial Cell\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0001064\",\n            \"term\": \"Neoplastic Cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0001525\",\n            \"term\": \"Angiogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0008283\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Proliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0006935\",\n            \"term\": \"Chemotaxis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0001666\",\n            \"term\": \"Response to Hypoxia\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D018303\",\n            \"term\": \"Tumor Growth\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D018909\",\n            \"term\": \"Neovascularization, Pathologic\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D000860\",\n            \"term\": \"Hypoxia\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002648\",\n            \"term\": \"Chemotaxis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D049109\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Proliferation\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a CompuCell3D simulation Python file based on the given ontology annotations. Let me start by recalling the structure of a typical CompuCell3D script.\n\nFirst, the necessary imports: CompuCellSetup and various modules from PySteppables. Then, a simulation class that inherits from SteppableBasePy. The class must have __init__, start, and step methods.\n\nThe ontology annotations mention two cell types: Endothelial and Neoplastic. So I'll define those in the start method using self.cellType. The GeneOntology terms include Chemotaxis, Cell Proliferation, Angiogenesis, Response to Hypoxia. MeSH terms include Hypoxia, Chemotaxis, etc. So the simulation should incorporate these processes.\n\nFor chemotaxis, I'll set up a chemical field, maybe 'Chemoattractant', and configure the chemotaxis parameters for Endothelial cells towards it. Hypoxia response might involve checking the cell's environment for low oxygen, but perhaps for simplicity, I can link it to a chemical field as well. Cell proliferation can be handled by setting a target volume and having cells divide when they exceed a certain volume. Angiogenesis might involve endothelial cell migration and possibly branching, but maybe that's too complex for a basic simulation. Instead, I can have endothelial cells move towards the chemotactic gradient, promoting neovascularization.\n\nIn the __init__ method, I'll initialize the steppable with the frequency. The start method will define cell types and set up the initial cells. For the step method, I'll check conditions each step\u2014maybe neoplastic cells grow over time, and endothelial cells undergo chemotaxis. Also, handle cell division based on volume.\n\nWait, need to set up the volume parameters. Each cell type should have a target volume and a lambda volume parameter to enforce cell growth. In the start method, I'll set the target volume and the lambda for each cell type.\n\nFor chemotaxis, I need to add a chemical field to the simulator and set the chemotaxis parameters for endothelial cells. So in the start method, add the chemical field and configure the chemotaxis plugin.\n\nAlso, the simulation needs to include plugins like Volume, Contact, Chemotaxis. So in the code, after the imports, there's usually a line to register the steppable, and setup the simulation with the necessary plugins.\n\nPutting it all together: Imports, then the simulation class with __init__, start, step. In start, define cell types, add chemical field, set up chemotaxis. In step, handle cell proliferation by checking volume and dividing. Maybe also adjust properties based on hypoxia, but that might require tracking oxygen levels. For simplicity, perhaps just include a basic response.\n\nWait, the user specified to include basic parameters based on the ontology. So make sure the code includes elements related to chemotaxis, cell proliferation, angiogenesis (via endothelial cell behavior), and hypoxia response. Maybe in the step method, check for some condition related to hypoxia and trigger angiogenesis or cell movement.\n\nBut to keep it simple, perhaps the step method includes a loop over cells, and if a cell is neoplastic and its volume is above a threshold, it divides. Similarly, endothelial cells might be set to move along the chemotactic gradient.\n\nI need to make sure all the required methods are present. The start method is where initial setup happens, like creating cells. The step method runs each simulation step. Also, ensure that the plugins are properly initialized.\n\nSo the final code should import necessary modules, define the simulation class with the required methods, set up cell types, chemical fields, volume and contact constraints, chemotaxis, and handle cell growth and division. Also, include the code to register the steppable and run the simulation.\n</think>\n\n```python\nfrom pycore.compucell import *\nimport CompuCellSetup\nfrom PySteppables import *\n\nclass TumorSimulation(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, _simulator, _frequency=10):\n        super().__init__(_simulator, _frequency)\n        self.chemotaxis_field = None\n        \n    def start(self):\n        self.build_initial_configuration()\n        self.add_chemical_fields()\n        self.configure_plugins()\n        self.initialize_cell_types()\n        self.setup_chemotaxis()\n        \n    def build_initial_configuration(self):\n        self.cell_type_endothelial = self.add_cell_type(\"Endothelial\")\n        self.cell_type_neoplastic = self.add_cell_type(\"Neoplastic\")\n        \n        for _ in range(100):\n            cell = self.potts.createCell()\n            cell.type = self.cell_type_endothelial\n            self.cell_field[self.random.randint(0,100), self.random.randint(0,100), 0] = cell\n            \n        for _ in range(50):\n            cell = self.potts.createCell()\n            cell.type = self.cell_type_neoplastic\n            self.cell_field[self.random.randint(0,100), self.random.randint(0,100), 0] = cell\n\n    def add_chemical_fields(self):\n        self.chemotaxis_field = self.create_scalar_field_chemical(\"Chemoattractant\")\n        self.chemotaxis_field[:, :, :] = np.random.rand(*self.chemotaxis_field.shape)\n\n    def configure_plugins(self):\n        volume_plugin = self.get_volume_plugin()\n        volume_plugin.set_volume_energy_params(16, 2, 0, 0)\n        \n        contact_plugin = self.get_contact_plugin()\n        contact_plugin.set_contact_energy(self.cell_type_endothelial, self.cell_type_endothelial, 16)\n        contact_plugin.set_contact_energy(self.cell_type_neoplastic, self.cell_type_neoplastic, 10)\n        contact_plugin.set_contact_energy(self.cell_type_endothelial, self.cell_type_neoplastic, 20)\n\n    def initialize_cell_types(self):\n        for cell in self.cell_list:\n            if cell.type == self.cell_type_endothelial:\n                cell.targetVolume = 25\n                cell.lambdaVolume = 2.0\n            elif cell.type == self.cell_type_neoplastic:\n                cell.targetVolume = 16\n                cell.lambdaVolume = 2.0\n\n    def setup_chemotaxis(self):\n        chemotaxis_plugin = self.get_chemotaxis_plugin()\n        chemotaxis_data = self.get_chemotaxis_data(self.cell_type_endothelial, \"Chemoattractant\")\n        chemotaxis_data.set_lambda(0.1)\n        chemotaxis_data.assign_chemotact_vect(0, 1, 0)  # Y-axis gradient following\n\n    def step(self, mcs):\n        self.update_hypoxia_response(mcs)\n        self.manage_cell_division()\n        self.diffuse_chemical_field()\n\n    def update_hypoxia_response(self, mcs):\n        if mcs % 50 == 0:\n            self.chemotaxis_field[:, :, :] = np.random.rand(*self.chemotaxis_field.shape)\n\n    def manage_cell_division(self):\n        for cell in self.cell_list:\n            if cell.volume > 2 * cell.targetVolume:\n                self.divide_cell_random_orientation(cell)\n\n    def diffuse_chemical_field(self):\n        self.chemotaxis_field[:, :, :] = 0.9 * self.chemotaxis_field[:, :, :] + \\\n                                        0.1 * (np.roll(self.chemotaxis_field, 1, axis=0) + \n                                               np.roll(self.chemotaxis_field, -1, axis=0) + \n                                               np.roll(self.chemotaxis_field, 1, axis=1) + \n                                               np.roll(self.chemotaxis_field, -1, axis=1)) / 4\n\nCompuCellSetup.register_steppable(steppable=TumorSimulation(CompuCellSetup.get_simulator()))\n```"

Maybe in the step method, check for some condition related to hypoxia and trigger angiogenesis or cell movement.\n\nBut to keep it simple, perhaps the step method includes a loop over cells, and if a cell is neoplastic and its volume is above a threshold, it divides. Similarly, endothelial cells might be set to move along the chemotactic gradient.\n\nI need to make sure all the required methods are present. The start method is where initial setup happens, like creating cells. The step method runs each simulation step. Also, ensure that the plugins are properly initialized.\n\nSo the final code should import necessary modules, define the simulation class with the required methods, set up cell types, chemical fields, volume and contact constraints, chemotaxis, and handle cell growth and division. Also, include the code to register the steppable and run the simulation.\n</think>",
