Initially, tumor cells proliferate as they take up the oxygen which the pre-existing vasculature supplies. The tumor grows exponentially. When the oxygen level drops below a threshold, the tumor cells become hypoxic and start secreting pro-angiogenic factors. At this stage, the tumor reaches a maximum diameter characteristic of an avascular tumor spheroid. The endothelial cells in the pre-existing vasculature respond to the pro-angiogenic factors both by chemotaxing towards higher concentrations of pro-angiogenic factors and by forming new blood vessels via angiogenesis. The tumor-induced vasculature increases the growth rate of the resulting vascularized solid tumor compared to an avascular tumor, allowing the tumor to grow beyond the spheroid in these lineargrowth phases. First, in the linear-spherical phase of growth, the tumor remains spherical while its volume increases. Second, in the linear-cylindrical phase of growth the tumor elongates into a cylinder. Finally, in the linear-sheet phase of growth, tumor growth accelerates as the tumor changes from cylindrical to paddle-shaped. Substantial periods during which the tumor grows slowly or not at all separate the exponential from the linear-spherical and the linear-spherical from the linear-cylindrical growth phases. In contrast to other simulations in which avascular tumors remain spherical, our simulated avascular tumors form cylinders following the blood vessels, leading to a different distribution of hypoxic cells within the tumor. Our simulations cover time periods which are long enough to produce a range of biologically reasonable complex morphologies, allowing us to study how tumor-induced angiogenesis affects the growth rate, size and morphology of simulated tumors."

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user wants ontology annotations based on the provided description of a vascular tumor growth simulation. They specified Cell Ontology, Gene Ontology, and MeSH terms. \n\nFirst, I need to identify relevant terms from each ontology. The description mentions tumor cells, endothelial cells, hypoxic cells, and blood vessels. For Cell Ontology, \"Endothelial Cell\" would be CL:0000115, \"Epithelial Cell\" is CL:0000066, but wait, the original text talks about tumor cells becoming hypoxic. Hypoxic cells might be a state rather than a cell type. Maybe \"Neoplastic Cell\" (CL:0001063) is more appropriate here. Endothelial cells are definitely part of the vasculature.\n\nFor Gene Ontology, processes like angiogenesis (GO:0001525), cell proliferation (GO:0008283), chemotaxis (GO:0006935), and response to hypoxia (GO:0001666) are mentioned. The tumor cells secrete pro-angiogenic factors, so maybe \"secretion by cell\" (GO:0032940)? Also, oxygen transport (GO:0015671) could be relevant due to oxygen supply from blood vessels.\n\nMeSH terms might include \"Neovascularization, Pathologic\" (D018908) for tumor-induced angiogenesis, \"Hypoxia\" (D000860), \"Cell Proliferation\" (D002460), and \"Neoplasms\" (D009369). The simulation involves tumor morphology changes, so \"Neoplasm Morphology\" (D055013) could fit. Also, \"Chemotaxis\" (D002648) is mentioned regarding endothelial cells moving towards pro-angiogenic factors.\n\nWait, need to check the exact IDs. Let me confirm:\n\n- Cell Ontology: Endothelial cell is CL:0000115, Neoplastic Cell is CL:0001063. Hypoxic cell isn't a specific term in CL, so maybe just the tumor cells and endothelial cells here.\n\n- Gene Ontology: Angiogenesis (GO:0001525), cell proliferation (GO:0008283), chemotaxis (GO:0006935), response to hypoxia (GO:0001666), secretion (GO:0046903)? Wait, the text says secretion of pro-angiogenic factors. The exact term might be \"secretion by cell\" (GO:0032940). Oxygen transport is GO:0015671.\n\n- MeSH: Pathologic neovascularization is D018908, Hypoxia D000860, Cell Proliferation D002460, Neoplasms D009369, Neoplasm Morphology D055013, Chemotaxis D002648.\n\nI need to make sure the terms are exact and the IDs are correctly formatted without spaces. Also, check if \"Epithelial\" was mentioned. The original text doesn't mention epithelial cells, but the example included it. Wait, the user's example uses \"Epithelial\" but in the actual problem description, maybe the tumor cells are neoplastic. So better to use Neoplastic Cell for CL. Also, the example had \"Cell Division\" but the problem text mentions proliferation more. So the GO terms should include cell proliferation, angiogenesis, chemotaxis, response to hypoxia, and secretion. MeSH terms should cover the pathological angiogenesis, hypoxia, cell proliferation, neoplasms, morphology, and chemotaxis.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have each category with the correct IDs and terms. Need to ensure no extra spaces and exact term names. Let me double-check each ID and term:\n\nCellOntology:\n- CL:0000115: Endothelial Cell\n- CL:0001063: Neoplastic Cell\n\nGeneOntology:\n- GO:0001525: angiogenesis\n- GO:0008283: cell population proliferation\n- GO:0006935: chemotaxis\n- GO:0001666: response to hypoxia\n- GO:0032940: secretion by cell\n- GO:0015671: oxygen transport\n\nMeSH:\n- D018908: Neovascularization, Pathologic\n- D000860: Hypoxia\n- D002460: Cell Proliferation\n- D009369: Neoplasms\n- D055013: Neoplasm Morphology\n- D002648: Chemotaxis\n\nYes, that seems to cover the key points from the description. Make sure the JSON structure is correct, arrays for each category, and terms as specified. No extra explanations, just the JSON.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000115\",\n            \"term\": \"Endothelial Cell\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0001063\",\n            \"term\": \"Neoplastic Cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0001525\",\n            \"term\": \"angiogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0008283\",\n            \"term\": \"cell population proliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0006935\",\n            \"term\": \"chemotaxis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0001666\",\n            \"term\": \"response to hypoxia\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0032940\",\n            \"term\": \"secretion by cell\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0015671\",\n            \"term\": \"oxygen transport\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D018908\",\n            \"term\": \"Neovascularization, Pathologic\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D000860\",\n            \"term\": \"Hypoxia\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002460\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Proliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D009369\",\n            \"term\": \"Neoplasms\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D055013\",\n            \"term\": \"Neoplasm Morphology\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002648\",\n            \"term\": \"Chemotaxis\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"

Let's start by recalling the structure of a typical CompuCell3D script.\n\nFirst, the necessary imports: CompuCellSetup and the steppables module. That's straightforward. Then, the simulation class should inherit from SteppableBasePy. The required methods are __init__, start, and step.\n\nLooking at the ontology annotations, there are two cell types: Endothelial and Neoplastic. So I'll define those in the start method using self.cellTypeDict. The parameters from the GeneOntology and MeSH terms need to be incorporated. For example, cell proliferation (GO:0008283, D002460) might involve setting a mitosis rate. Secretion (GO:0032940) could involve secreting a chemical like VEGF. Response to hypoxia (GO:0001666, D000860) and angiogenesis (GO:0001525, D018908) suggest that under low oxygen, cells might secrete more VEGF. Chemotaxis (GO:0006935, D002648) would mean cells move towards a chemical gradient, perhaps VEGF. Oxygen transport (GO:0015671) implies an oxygen field.\n\nIn the __init__ method, I'll initialize the simulation with necessary parameters like mitosis rate, hypoxia threshold, VEGF secretion rate, and chemotaxis parameters. The start method sets up the cell types and initializes fields. In the step method, I'll handle cell proliferation, check oxygen levels for hypoxia response, and update secretion and chemotaxis.\n\nI need to create a chemical field for oxygen and VEGF. The step method will loop through each cell: if it's a Neoplastic cell and the oxygen level is low, secrete more VEGF. Endothelial cells should perform chemotaxis towards VEGF. Also, handle cell division based on the mitosis rate.\n\nMake sure all the parameters are properly defined and used in the relevant sections.
