Pathologists characterize DCIS by four tissue morphologies (micropapillary, cribriform, solid, and comedo), but the underlying mechanisms that distinguish the development and progression of these morphologies are not well understood. Here we explored the conditions leading to the emergence of the different morphologies of DCIS using a two-dimensional multi-cell lattice-based model that incorporates cell proliferation, apoptosis, necrosis, adhesion, and contractility. We found that the relative rates of cell proliferation and apoptosis governed which of the four morphologies emerged. High proliferation and low apoptosis favored the emergence of solid and comedo morphologies. In contrast, low proliferation and high apoptosis led to the micropapillary morphology, whereas high proliferation and high apoptosis led to the cribriform morphology. The natural progression between morphologies cannot be investigated in vivo since lesions are usually surgically removed upon detection; however, our model suggests probable transitions between these morphologies during breast cancer progression. Importantly, cribriform and comedo appear to be the ultimate morphologies of DCIS. Motivated by previous experimental studies demonstrating that tumor cells behave differently depending on where they are located within the mammary duct in vivo or in engineered tissues, we examined the effects of tissue geometry on the progression of DCIS. In agreement with our previous experimental work, we found that cells are more likely to invade from the end of ducts and that this preferential invasion is regulated by cell adhesion and contractility. This model provides additional insight into tumor cell behavior and allows the exploration of phenotypic transitions not easily monitored in vivo."

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by breaking down the original description to identify relevant terms for each ontology category. \n\nFirst, CellOntology. The text mentions \"mammary epithelial cells\" so I need to find the correct CL ID for that. The term should be \"mammary epithelial cell\" and the ID is likely CL:0002501. I should check if that's the exact term and ID. Also, since DCIS involves abnormal proliferation of these cells, maybe there's a specific CL term for neoplastic epithelial cells. Let me confirm. There's CL:0008032 \"neoplastic epithelial cell\", which fits here.\n\nNext, GeneOntology. The processes mentioned include cell proliferation (GO:0008283), apoptosis (GO:0006915), adhesion (GO:0007155), and contractility. For contractility, maybe \"cell contractility\" is GO:0042645. Also, the model is a lattice-based model, which might relate to \"multicellular organismal process\" (GO:0032501). Necrosis is mentioned too, so \"necrotic cell death\" is GO:0070265.\n\nFor MeSH terms, the main topics are Ductal Carcinoma in situ (D018301), Breast Neoplasms (D001943), Cell Proliferation (D049109), Apoptosis (D017209), Cell Adhesion (D015815), and Necrosis (D009336). Tissue geometry could be under \"Tissue Engineering\" (D019197), but the text mentions \"tissue geometry\" specifically. However, MeSH might not have an exact term for that, so maybe Tissue Engineering is the closest. Also, \"cell invasion\" could relate to \"Neoplasm Invasiveness\" (D009361).\n\nI need to ensure all IDs are correctly formatted without spaces. Let me double-check each term and ID:\n\n- CellOntology: mammary epithelial cell (CL:0002501), neoplastic epithelial cell (CL:0008032)\n- GeneOntology: cell proliferation (GO:0008283), apoptotic process (GO:0006915), cell adhesion (GO:0007155), cell contractility (GO:0042645), necrotic cell death (GO:0070265), multicellular organismal process (GO:0032501)\n- MeSH: Ductal Carcinoma in situ (D018301), Breast Neoplasms (D001943), Cell Proliferation (D049109), Apoptosis (D017209), Cell Adhesion (D015815), Necrosis (D009336), Neoplasm Invasiveness (D009361), Tissue Engineering (D019197)\n\nMake sure the terms are spelled exactly as per the ontologies. For example, \"apoptotic process\" instead of apoptosis in GO. MeSH uses \"Apoptosis\" and \"Cell Proliferation\" as terms. Also, check if \"necrotic cell death\" is the correct term in GO. Yes, GO:0070265 is necrotic cell death. \n\nFinally, structure the JSON correctly with the exact category names and proper formatting. No extra spaces in IDs or terms. Verify each entry against the ontologies to ensure accuracy.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0002501\",\n            \"term\": \"mammary epithelial cell\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0008032\",\n            \"term\": \"neoplastic epithelial cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0008283\",\n            \"term\": \"cell proliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0006915\",\n            \"term\": \"apoptotic process\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007155\",\n            \"term\": \"cell adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0042645\",\n            \"term\": \"cell contractility\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0070265\",\n            \"term\": \"necrotic cell death\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0032501\",\n            \"term\": \"multicellular organismal process\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D018301\",\n            \"term\": \"Ductal Carcinoma in situ\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D001943\",\n            \"term\": \"Breast Neoplasms\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D049109\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Proliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D017209\",\n            \"term\": \"Apoptosis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D015815\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D009336\",\n            \"term\": \"Necrosis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D009361\",\n            \"term\": \"Neoplasm Invasiveness\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D019197\",\n            \"term\": \"Tissue Engineering\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```"

First, I need to make sure I include all the required components: imports, a simulation class inheriting from SteppableBasePy, and the __init__, start, and step methods.\n\nThe CellOntology mentions mammary and neoplastic epithelial cells. So I'll define those cell types. The GeneOntology includes processes like necrosis, apoptosis, adhesion, proliferation, contractility. MeSH terms add things like Neoplasm Invasiveness and Breast Neoplasms, which might relate to cell behaviors.\n\nStarting with the imports: CompuCellSetup and the necessary modules like steppables, cc3d, and numpy. Then, the simulation class. In __init__, I'll call the parent's init. The start method will set up the cell types and their parameters. For the cell types, I'll create 'MammaryEpithelial' and 'NeoplasticEpithelial'. Maybe assign different contact energies to handle adhesion (GO:0007155). \n\nIn the start method, I'll also initialize the cell field and maybe some cells. Using the CellInventory and CellG to create cells at certain positions. For the step method, handle processes each step. Since there's apoptosis and necrosis, I'll check for conditions like volume or a random chance to trigger death. Using maybe a probability in step to kill some cells. Also, proliferation (GO:0008283) could be handled by checking cell volume and dividing if it's large enough.\n\nContact energy between the cell types is important for adhesion and invasiveness. Neoplastic cells might have lower adhesion to promote invasion (D009361). Apoptosis (D017209) and necrosis (D009336) can be modeled by changing the cell type's target volume and then killing them if they shrink too much. Or using the built-in functions like killCell().\n\nNeed to set parameters like targetVolume, lambdaVolume for contractility (GO:0042645). Maybe set different parameters for neoplastic cells. Also, in the step method, loop over all cells and apply these checks. For example, if a cell's volume is below a threshold, mark it for apoptosis or necrosis. Using a random chance each step to decide if a cell should start apoptosis.\n\nWait, in CompuCell3D, apoptosis is often handled by changing the target volume and then the cell shrinks. Once it's small enough, it's removed. So in the step method, I can iterate through each cell, check if it's supposed to undergo apoptosis or necrosis, adjust the targetVolume accordingly.\n\nFor proliferation, maybe when a cell reaches a certain volume, it divides. Using the cell.targetVolume and checking current volume. If volume > 2 * targetVolume, then divide. Or use a simpler check. Also, in the step method, handle cell division.\n\nSo putting it all together: in start, define cell types and their properties. In step, loop through cells, check for death conditions, adjust target volumes, and handle division. Also, include contact energy between cell types and medium to simulate adhesion.\n\nI need to make sure all the required ontology terms are addressed through the parameters and behaviors. For example, cell contractility is handled by lambdaVolume, which is the energy term for volume constraint. Necrosis and apoptosis are modeled by different death processes.
