        "description": "Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a heterogeneous group of non-invasive lesions of the breast that result from abnormal proliferation of mammary epithelial cells. Pathologists characterize DCIS by four tissue morphologies (micropapillary, cribriform, solid, and comedo), but the underlying mechanisms that distinguish the development and progression of these morphologies are not well understood. Here we explored the conditions leading to the emergence of the different morphologies of DCIS using a two-dimensional multi-cell lattice-based model that incorporates cell proliferation, apoptosis, necrosis, adhesion, and contractility. We found that the relative rates of cell proliferation and apoptosis governed which of the four morphologies emerged. High proliferation and low apoptosis favored the emergence of solid and comedo morphologies. In contrast, low proliferation and high apoptosis led to the micropapillary morphology, whereas high proliferation and high apoptosis led to the cribriform morphology. The natural progression between morphologies cannot be investigated in vivo since lesions are usually surgically removed upon detection; however, our model suggests probable transitions between these morphologies during breast cancer progression. Importantly, cribriform and comedo appear to be the ultimate morphologies of DCIS. Motivated by previous experimental studies demonstrating that tumor cells behave differently depending on where they are located within the mammary duct in vivo or in engineered tissues, we examined the effects of tissue geometry on the progression of DCIS. In agreement with our previous experimental work, we found that cells are more likely to invade from the end of ducts and that this preferential invasion is regulated by cell adhesion and contractility. This model provides additional insight into tumor cell behavior and allows the exploration of phenotypic transitions not easily monitored in vivo."

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by parsing the user's request. They want a JSON object with ontology annotations based on the provided description of Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The categories must be exactly \"CellOntology\", \"GeneOntology\", and \"MeSH\". Each entry needs precise IDs and terms without extra spaces.\n\nFirst, I'll look for Cell Ontology terms. The description mentions \"mammary epithelial cells\". Checking the Cell Ontology, \"mammary epithelial cell\" is CL:0000718. So that's one entry under CellOntology.\n\nNext, Gene Ontology. The model includes processes like cell proliferation (GO:0008283), apoptosis (GO:0006915), adhesion (GO:0007155), and contractility. Contractility might be under \"cell motility\" but more accurately, \"cellular contractility\" is GO:0045053. Also, necrosis (GO:0070269) is mentioned. These should go into GeneOntology with their respective IDs.\n\nFor MeSH terms, DCIS itself is D018301. Terms like \"Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating\" is MeSH D018301. Breast Neoplasms is D001943. Cell adhesion is D015815, and Cell proliferation is D049109. Apoptosis is D017209. Necrosis might be D009336. These should be included in the MeSH array.\n\nNeed to ensure all IDs are correctly formatted without spaces. Check each term's exact name. For example, \"Cell Adhesion\" not \"Cell adhesion\" for GO. Similarly, MeSH terms like \"Apoptosis\" and \"Necrosis\" are correct as they are.\n\nDouble-checking the IDs: CL:0000718 for mammary epithelial cell, GO terms as listed. MeSH IDs for DCIS, breast neoplasms, etc. Make sure no typos in the IDs. For example, D018301 is correct for DCIS.\n\nAlso, verify that all terms from the original text are covered: proliferation, apoptosis, adhesion, contractility, necrosis, and the relevant cell type. Tissue morphologies like micropapillary, etc., but maybe those are specific pathology terms not in ontologies, so stick to what's in the provided ontologies.\n\nFinally, structure the JSON as specified, only including the three categories with arrays of objects each having \"id\" and \"term\".

The user mentioned required imports, so I'll include those.\n\nNext, the simulation class must inherit from SteppableBasePy. The class should have __init__, start, and step methods. In the __init__, I'll make sure to call the parent class's __init__ method.\n\nLooking at the ontology annotations, the cell type is mammary epithelial cell. So I'll define that cell type. The Gene Ontology terms include Cellular Contractility, Cell Adhesion, Apoptosis, Necrosis, and Cell Proliferation. MeSH terms add Breast Neoplasms and Carcinoma references. This suggests the simulation might involve processes like cell adhesion, death (apoptosis/necrosis), proliferation, and possibly tumor formation.\n\nIn the start method, I need to set up the cell types. I'll create a basic epithelial cell type. Then, maybe set up some initial cells. Perhaps a blob of epithelial cells in the center.\n\nFor parameters: cell adhesion can be handled by setting appropriate contact energies between cell types and the medium. Apoptosis and necrosis can be modeled by checking cell volume or other properties and triggering death. Proliferation might involve cells dividing after a certain number of steps.\n\nIn the step method, which runs every MCS, I'll loop through all cells. For each cell, check if it's dead. If not, maybe check for apoptosis (like random chance or volume) or necrosis (if volume is too low). For proliferation, after a certain interval, a cell might divide. Also, contractility could affect cell membrane fluctuations.\n\nI'll set up contact energy between cells and medium to manage adhesion. Maybe lower energy for same cell type to encourage sticking together.\n\nAlso, need to register the steppable with CompuCellSetup. So after defining the class, use CompuCellSetup.register_steppable.\n\nWait, the user wants basic parameters based on the ontology. So Cellular Contractility might relate to cell membrane parameters, like lambda_volume or target volume.

Also, set target volume and lambda volume for contractility.\n\nI'll need to define the cell types, maybe epithelial and a default medium. Then, in contact energy, set epithelial-epithelial and epithelial-medium energies.\n\nIn the step method, loop through cells. For each cell, if not dead, check volume.
