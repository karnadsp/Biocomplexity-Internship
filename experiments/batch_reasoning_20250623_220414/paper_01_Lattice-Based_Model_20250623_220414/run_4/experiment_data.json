        "description": "Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a heterogeneous group of non-invasive lesions of the breast that result from abnormal proliferation of mammary epithelial cells. Pathologists characterize DCIS by four tissue morphologies (micropapillary, cribriform, solid, and comedo), but the underlying mechanisms that distinguish the development and progression of these morphologies are not well understood. Here we explored the conditions leading to the emergence of the different morphologies of DCIS using a two-dimensional multi-cell lattice-based model that incorporates cell proliferation, apoptosis, necrosis, adhesion, and contractility. We found that the relative rates of cell proliferation and apoptosis governed which of the four morphologies emerged. High proliferation and low apoptosis favored the emergence of solid and comedo morphologies. In contrast, low proliferation and high apoptosis led to the micropapillary morphology, whereas high proliferation and high apoptosis led to the cribriform morphology. The natural progression between morphologies cannot be investigated in vivo since lesions are usually surgically removed upon detection; however, our model suggests probable transitions between these morphologies during breast cancer progression. Importantly, cribriform and comedo appear to be the ultimate morphologies of DCIS. Motivated by previous experimental studies demonstrating that tumor cells behave differently depending on where they are located within the mammary duct in vivo or in engineered tissues, we examined the effects of tissue geometry on the progression of DCIS. In agreement with our previous experimental work, we found that cells are more likely to invade from the end of ducts and that this preferential invasion is regulated by cell adhesion and contractility. This model provides additional insight into tumor cell behavior and allows the exploration of phenotypic transitions not easily monitored in vivo."

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this ontology annotation task. The user wants a JSON object with three categories: CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH. Each category should have the correct IDs and terms based on the provided description.\n\nFirst, looking at the original description, it mentions \"abnormal proliferation of mammary epithelial cells.\" So for CellOntology, \"mammary epithelial cells\" would be relevant. The Cell Ontology ID for mammary epithelial cells is CL:0002493. That should go under CellOntology.\n\nNext, GeneOntology terms. The model includes processes like cell proliferation, apoptosis, necrosis, adhesion, and contractility. Let me check the GO terms. Cell proliferation is GO:0008283, apoptosis is GO:0006915, necrosis might be GO:0070269 (necrotic cell death), cell adhesion is GO:0007155, and contractility could be GO:0006936 (muscle contraction) but wait, maybe cell contractility specifically. Hmm, maybe GO:0030031 (cell projection assembly) isn't right. Alternatively, cell-substrate adhesion might be involved. Wait, the model includes adhesion and contractility. Cell adhesion is definitely GO:0007155. Contractility might be GO:0043274 (regulation of cell membrane rigidity) or perhaps GO:0030030 (cell projection organization). Alternatively, maybe \"cell motility\" terms. Alternatively, maybe actomyosin contractility. Let me check. The exact term for contractility here might be tricky. Alternatively, maybe \"cell migration\" if that's part of the model's mechanisms. But the description says \"adhesion and contractility,\" so perhaps GO:0006921 (cellular component movement involved in cell invasion) but that's too specific. Alternatively, maybe \"cell-substrate adhesion\" (GO:0031589) and \"cell contractility\" as part of cytoskeleton organization. Alternatively, maybe GO:0030036 (actin cytoskeleton organization). Hmm, I need to be precise. Let me confirm. For cell adhesion, the correct term is \"cell adhesion\" with GO:0007155. Contractility might relate to \"cell motility\" (GO:0016477) or \"regulation of cell shape\" (GO:0008360). Alternatively, \"actomyosin structure organization\" (GO:0031032). Since the model mentions contractility affecting invasion, maybe GO:0006928 (cell motion). But the description specifically mentions \"adhesion and contractility\" as factors. Maybe \"cell-substrate adhesion\" (GO:0031589) and \"actomyosin contractile ring assembly\" (GO:0070694)? Wait, maybe contractility here refers to cellular contractility in general, which is part of the cytoskeleton. So perhaps GO:0007010 (cytoskeleton organization). Alternatively, looking up contractility in GO, the term \"cell contractility\" isn't a primary term. Maybe \"muscle contraction\" but that's specific. Alternatively, \"cell migration\" (GO:0016477) could be related. Since the model mentions contractility in the context of invasion and tissue geometry, perhaps cell migration is appropriate. Alternatively, \"regulation of cell adhesion\" (GO:0030155) might be relevant. Hmm, maybe better to stick to the exact terms mentioned. The processes are proliferation, apoptosis, necrosis, adhesion, contractility. So for each of these, find the GO term. Proliferation: GO:0008283 (cell population proliferation). Apoptosis: GO:0006915 (apoptotic process). Necrosis: GO:0070269 (necrotic cell death). Adhesion: GO:0007155 (cell adhesion). Contractility: Maybe GO:0030031 (actin cytoskeleton organization), but the term \"contractility\" isn't directly there. Alternatively, maybe \"cell motility\" (GO:0016477) as a broader term. Alternatively, \"regulation of cell shape\" (GO:0008360). But perhaps the correct approach is to include the terms explicitly mentioned. So cell adhesion (GO:0007155) and contractility. If there's no exact term for contractility, maybe skip it, but the user expects GeneOntology terms. Alternatively, check if \"cell contractility\" is a synonym in any GO term. Looking it up, \"contractility\" might be part of \"muscle cell contraction\" (GO:0086007), but that's specific. Alternatively, \"cell motility\" (GO:0016477) could be acceptable. Alternatively, maybe \"cellular component movement\" (GO:0006928). Alternatively, since the model's mechanisms include adhesion and contractility affecting invasion, perhaps \"cell migration\" (GO:0016477). So maybe include cell adhesion (GO:0007155), cell proliferation (GO:0008283), apoptotic process (GO:0006915), necrotic cell death (GO:0070269), and cell migration (GO:0016477). Alternatively, check if there's a term for cell contractility. Alternatively, maybe \"regulation of cell size\" (GO:0008361) or \"cell morphogenesis\" (GO:0000902). Hmm. The user wants exact term names. The original text mentions \"adhesion and contractility\" as factors. If \"contractility\" is part of cell mechanics, maybe \"cell-substrate adhesion\" (GO:0031589) and \"cellular mechanical behavior\" (GO:0072652). Wait, GO:0072652 is \"maintenance of protein localization in cell cortex\". Not that. Maybe \"cellular mechanical behavior\" is a different term. Alternatively, \"cell cortex contractility\" (GO:0031267), but that's part of cytokinesis. Alternatively, perhaps \"regulation of actin cytoskeleton organization\" (GO:0032963). Since the exact term is needed, and \"contractility\" isn't directly present, maybe it's better to stick with the processes explicitly mentioned in the model: proliferation, apoptosis, necrosis, adhesion. Contractility might not have a direct GO term, so perhaps omit. Alternatively, check MeSH terms for contractility. Wait, the user also wants MeSH terms. Let's think about MeSH. The original text discusses breast cancer, DCIS, cell proliferation, apoptosis, necrosis, adhesion, contractility, tissue morphology, tumor cell invasion. So MeSH terms would be like \"Breast Neoplasms\" (D001943), \"Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating\" (D018300), \"Cell Proliferation\" (D049109), \"Apoptosis\" (D017209), \"Necrosis\" (D009336), \"Cell Adhesion\" (D015815), \"Cell Movement\" (D002465), \"Neoplasm Invasiveness\" (D010003), \"Tissue Engineering\" (D020530), \"Disease Progression\" (D018895). So for MeSH, include these. Now, back to GeneOntology. The model includes cell proliferation (GO:0008283), apoptosis (GO:0006915), necrosis (GO:0070269), adhesion (GO:0007155). Contractility might not have a direct term, so maybe exclude unless there's a specific term. Alternatively, maybe \"cell motility\" (GO:0016477). But the original text says \"contractility\" is a factor, so perhaps \"cell migration\" is the closest. So include GO:0016477 (cell migration). Also, the model mentions tissue geometry effects, which might relate to \"cell-substrate adhesion\" (GO:0031589). But again, need exact terms. Let's confirm the IDs: GO:0008283 (cell population proliferation), GO:0006915 (apoptotic process), GO:0070269 (necrotic cell death), GO:0007155 (cell adhesion), GO:0016477 (cell migration). Those seem relevant.\n\nFor MeSH, the main topics are Ductal carcinoma in situ (MeSH D018300), breast neoplasms (D001943), cell proliferation (D049109), apoptosis (D017209), necrosis (D009336), cell adhesion (D015815), neoplasm invasiveness (D010003), disease progression (D018895), and maybe tissue engineering (D020530) since they mention engineered tissues. So include those.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nCellOntology: mammary epithelial cell (CL:0002493)\nGeneOntology: cell population proliferation (GO:0008283), apoptotic process (GO:0006915), necrotic cell death (GO:0070269), cell adhesion (GO:0007155), cell migration (GO:0016477)\nMeSH: Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating (D018300), Breast Neoplasms (D001943), Cell Proliferation (D049109), Apoptosis (D017209), Necrosis (D009336), Cell Adhesion (D015815), Neoplasm Invasiveness (D010003), Disease Progression (D018895)\n\nMake sure the terms are spelled exactly as in the ontologies. For example, \"Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating\" is the exact MeSH term for DCIS. Check the MeSH terms for correctness. Yes, D018300 is correct for DCIS. Also, \"Breast Neoplasms\" is D001943. \"Cell Proliferation\" is D049109. \"Apoptosis\" is D017209. \"Necrosis\" is D009336. \"Cell"
