        "description": "Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a heterogeneous group of non-invasive lesions of the breast that result from abnormal proliferation of mammary epithelial cells. Pathologists characterize DCIS by four tissue morphologies (micropapillary, cribriform, solid, and comedo), but the underlying mechanisms that distinguish the development and progression of these morphologies are not well understood. Here we explored the conditions leading to the emergence of the different morphologies of DCIS using a two-dimensional multi-cell lattice-based model that incorporates cell proliferation, apoptosis, necrosis, adhesion, and contractility. We found that the relative rates of cell proliferation and apoptosis governed which of the four morphologies emerged. High proliferation and low apoptosis favored the emergence of solid and comedo morphologies. In contrast, low proliferation and high apoptosis led to the micropapillary morphology, whereas high proliferation and high apoptosis led to the cribriform morphology. The natural progression between morphologies cannot be investigated in vivo since lesions are usually surgically removed upon detection; however, our model suggests probable transitions between these morphologies during breast cancer progression. Importantly, cribriform and comedo appear to be the ultimate morphologies of DCIS. Motivated by previous experimental studies demonstrating that tumor cells behave differently depending on where they are located within the mammary duct in vivo or in engineered tissues, we examined the effects of tissue geometry on the progression of DCIS. In agreement with our previous experimental work, we found that cells are more likely to invade from the end of ducts and that this preferential invasion is regulated by cell adhesion and contractility. This model provides additional insight into tumor cell behavior and allows the exploration of phenotypic transitions not easily monitored in vivo."

      "response": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this query. The user wants a JSON object with structured ontology annotations for the provided description of Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The key is to extract relevant terms from Cell Ontology (CL), Gene Ontology (GO), and MeSH.\n\nFirst, looking at the original description: DCIS involves abnormal proliferation of mammary epithelial cells. So, the CellOntology should include \"Mammary Epithelial Cell\". Checking the CL, the correct ID is CL:0002492.\n\nNext, the processes mentioned are cell proliferation, apoptosis, necrosis, adhesion, and contractility. For GeneOntology, these correspond to terms like \"Cell Proliferation\" (GO:0008283), \"Apoptotic Process\" (GO:0006915), \"Necrosis\" (GO:0070269), \"Cell Adhesion\" (GO:0007155), and \"Actomyosin Contractility\" (GO:0031032). Need to confirm the exact IDs for these terms.\n\nFor MeSH terms, the main concepts here are \"Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating\" (D018301) since DCIS is a type of non-invasive carcinoma. Also mentioned are cell invasion and tissue geometry, which relate to \"Neoplasm Invasiveness\" (D009361) and possibly \"Breast Neoplasms\" (D001943). However, \"Breast Neoplasms\" might be too broad, but since the context is specifically DCIS, D018301 is more precise. \"Cell Adhesion\" in MeSH is D002448, and \"Cell Proliferation\" is D002460.\n\nWait, the example format uses \"Epithelial\" under CellOntology, but here it's \"Mammary Epithelial Cell\". Need to make sure the term is exact. The CL entry for mammary epithelial cells is indeed \"mammary epithelial cell\" with the ID CL:0002492. The term should be written as \"Mammary Epithelial Cell\" (capitalized).\n\nFor GeneOntology, checking each term:\n- Cell Proliferation: GO:0008283\n- Apoptotic Process: GO:0006915\n- Necrosis: GO:0070269 (exact term is \"Necrosis\" in GO?)\nWait, in GO, the term is \"Necrosis\" (GO:0070267) but the description mentions \"necrosis\" as a process. Let me verify. GO:0070269 is \"necrotic cell death\", but sometimes referred to as necrosis. The exact term might vary. Let me check the GO database. Hmm, GO:0070269 is \"necroptotic process\", which is a programmed form. The user's text mentions necrosis, which is more like unprogrammed cell death. However, in GO, the term for necrosis is GO:0070267. Wait, no. Let me check again. According to the GO browser, \"Necrosis\" (GO:0070267) is a child term of \"cell death\" (GO:0008219). So correct ID is GO:0070267. But the user's example uses \"Necrosis\" with GO:0006915. Wait, no, the example was just an example. Need to confirm actual IDs.\n\nWait, the original text mentions \"necrosis\" as a process included in the model. The correct GO term for necrosis is \"Necrosis\" (GO:0070267). Similarly, \"Actomyosin Contractility\" is GO:0031032. \"Cell Adhesion\" is GO:0007155. \n\nFor MeSH, \"Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating\" is D018301. \"Neoplasm Invasiveness\" is D009361. \"Cell Adhesion\" is D002448, and \"Cell Proliferation\" is D002460. Also, \"Apoptosis\" in MeSH is D017209. But the original text mentions apoptosis as a process, so including that. Wait, the MeSH term for Apoptosis is \"Apoptosis\" (D017209). So should that be included? The model incorporates apoptosis, so yes. But the user's example didn't include MeSH terms for processes, but maybe the answer should. However, the example provided in the user's message included \"Cell Proliferation\" under MeSH. So perhaps processes are included in MeSH as well.\n\nWait, the user's example has \"Cell Proliferation\" under MeSH with ID D000000. So in their example, processes are included in MeSH. Therefore, for the current case, MeSH terms would include \"Cell Proliferation\" (D002460), \"Apoptosis\" (D017209), \"Necrosis\" (D009666), \"Cell Adhesion\" (D002448), \"Actomyosin Contractility\" \u2014 but does MeSH have a term for contractility? Let's check. Actomyosin contractility might not have a direct MeSH term. The model also mentions adhesion and contractility. For MeSH, \"Cell Adhesion\" is D002448. Contractility might be under \"Muscle Contraction\" (D009131) but that's specific to muscle. Alternatively, \"Cell Movement\" (D002465) or \"Cytoskeletal Contraction\" (D053685). Wait, MeSH term \"Cytoskeleton\" (D003593), but not sure about contractility. Maybe better to omit if not certain. The original model includes \"contractility\" as a parameter, so perhaps MeSH terms related to cell movement or cytoskeleton. Alternatively, since the user example includes \"Cell Proliferation\" under MeSH, but not contractility, perhaps stick to the terms that are clearly present. So MeSH terms would include \"Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating\" (D018301), \"Neoplasm Invasiveness\" (D009361), \"Cell Proliferation\" (D002460), \"Apoptosis\" (D017209), \"Cell Adhesion\" (D002448). Also, the text mentions tissue geometry effects, so maybe \"Breast Neoplasms\" (D001943) as well. But the primary focus is DCIS, so D018301 is more specific.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nCellOntology: Mammary Epithelial Cell (CL:0002492)\nGeneOntology: Cell Proliferation (GO:0008283), Apoptotic Process (GO:0006915), Necrosis (GO:0070267), Cell Adhesion (GO:0007155), Actomyosin Contractility (GO:0031032)\nMeSH: Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating (D018301), Neoplasm Invasiveness (D009361), Cell Proliferation (D002460), Apoptosis (D017209), Cell Adhesion (D002448)\n\nWait, but in the original text, \"contractility\" is mentioned. The GO term for actomyosin contractility is GO:0031032. So that's correct. For MeSH, maybe there's no direct term, so omit. Also, the model discusses invasion, so \"Neoplasm Invasiveness\" (D009361) is appropriate. \n\nDouble-checking all IDs:\n\nCL:0002492 - Mammary Epithelial Cell (correct)\nGO:0008283 - cell proliferation (exact term is \"cell population proliferation\", but the exact term in the ontology is \"cell proliferation\"? Wait, GO:0008283 is \"cell population proliferation\", but the term is often referred to as \"cell proliferation\". However, the exact term name must be as per the ontology. Checking the GO term for GO:0008283, the term is \"cell population proliferation\". But the user example has \"Cell Division\" as a term. So need to use the exact term name. Wait, in the user example, \"Cell Division\" is under GO with ID GO:0000000, which is a placeholder. The actual term for cell proliferation is \"cell population proliferation\" (GO:0008283), but the user might expect the term to be \"Cell Proliferation\". However, in the Gene Ontology, the exact term is \"cell population proliferation\". But maybe the user is expecting \"Cell Proliferation\" as the term. This is a problem. Wait, let me check the actual GO term. \n\nLooking up GO:0008283: The term is \"cell population proliferation\" (exact name), but synonyms include \"cell proliferation\". So the user's example uses \"Cell Division\" (GO:0000000 as an example), but here we need to use the exact term. So the correct term for GO:0008283 is \"cell population proliferation\", but the user's text mentions \"cell proliferation\". However, the instruction says term names must be exact. Therefore, we have to use the exact term from the ontology, which is \"cell population proliferation\". But this might be an issue. Alternatively, perhaps the user is expecting \"Cell Proliferation\" as the term. But according to GO, the exact term is \"cell population proliferation\". This is a conflict. The user's example uses \"Cell Division\" which is a different term (GO:0051301). Hmm. The original text mentions \"cell proliferation\" multiple times. The correct GO term is \"cell proliferation\" (GO:0008283)? Wait, no. Let me check again. \n\nWait, GO:0008283 is \"positive regulation of cell population proliferation\". No, that"
