        "description": "Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a heterogeneous group of non-invasive lesions of the breast that result from abnormal proliferation of mammary epithelial cells. Pathologists characterize DCIS by four tissue morphologies (micropapillary, cribriform, solid, and comedo), but the underlying mechanisms that distinguish the development and progression of these morphologies are not well understood. Here we explored the conditions leading to the emergence of the different morphologies of DCIS using a two-dimensional multi-cell lattice-based model that incorporates cell proliferation, apoptosis, necrosis, adhesion, and contractility. We found that the relative rates of cell proliferation and apoptosis governed which of the four morphologies emerged. High proliferation and low apoptosis favored the emergence of solid and comedo morphologies. In contrast, low proliferation and high apoptosis led to the micropapillary morphology, whereas high proliferation and high apoptosis led to the cribriform morphology. The natural progression between morphologies cannot be investigated in vivo since lesions are usually surgically removed upon detection; however, our model suggests probable transitions between these morphologies during breast cancer progression. Importantly, cribriform and comedo appear to be the ultimate morphologies of DCIS. Motivated by previous experimental studies demonstrating that tumor cells behave differently depending on where they are located within the mammary duct in vivo or in engineered tissues, we examined the effects of tissue geometry on the progression of DCIS. In agreement with our previous experimental work, we found that cells are more likely to invade from the end of ducts and that this preferential invasion is regulated by cell adhesion and contractility. This model provides additional insight into tumor cell behavior and allows the exploration of phenotypic transitions not easily monitored in vivo."

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants a JSON object with ontology annotations for CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH based on the provided description of Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). \n\nFirst, I need to parse the original description carefully. The key elements mentioned are mammary epithelial cells, cell proliferation, apoptosis, necrosis, adhesion, contractility, and terms like ductal carcinoma in situ. Also, tissue morphologies like micropapillary, cribriform, solid, and comedo are noted.\n\nFor CellOntology, the main cell type mentioned is mammary epithelial cells. The correct CL ID for that is CL:0000182. So I'll add that under CellOntology.\n\nNext, GeneOntology terms. The processes discussed include cell proliferation (GO:0008283), apoptosis (GO:0006915), cell adhesion (GO:0007155), and contractility. Contractility might be under muscle cell contraction, but the context here is more about cell movement or structural changes. Maybe \"cellular contractility\" but checking GO, there's \"actomyosin contractile ring assembly\" (GO:0036159) but that's specific. Alternatively, \"regulation of cell shape\" (GO:0008360) or \"cell motility\" (GO:0016477). The description mentions contractility in the context of invasion, so maybe \"cell motility\" is more appropriate. Also, necrosis is mentioned, which is GO:0070269 (necrotic cell death). So include that.\n\nFor MeSH terms, DCIS is a type of breast neoplasm, so MeSH D001943. Also, terms like cell proliferation (D002466), apoptosis (D017209), cell adhesion (D015815), and cell movement (D002465) since contractility relates to movement. Necrosis would be D009336. Carcinoma in situ is D018301. The morphologies (micropapillary, etc.) might not have direct MeSH terms, but the main focus is on DCIS and the processes involved.\n\nI need to ensure IDs are correctly formatted without spaces. Check each term's ID:\n\n- Mammary epithelial cells: CL:0000182\n- Cell proliferation: GO:0008283\n- Apoptosis: GO:0006915\n- Cell adhesion: GO:0007155\n- Necrosis: GO:0070269\n- Cell motility: GO:0016477 (since contractility affects movement)\n- For MeSH: Ductal carcinoma: D018301 (Carcinoma, Ductal), Breast Neoplasms: D001943, Cell Proliferation: D002466, Apoptosis: D017209, Cell Adhesion: D015815, Necrosis: D009336, Cell Movement: D002465\n\nWait, DCIS specifically is a type of breast carcinoma in situ. MeSH term for Carcinoma in Situ is D018301, and Breast Neoplasms is D001943. So both should be included. \n\nCheck if \"Ductal carcinoma in situ\" has a specific MeSH ID. Looking it up, yes: D054533. So replace D018301 with D054533 for DCIS. \n\nSo MeSH entries would be:\n- Ductal carcinoma in situ (D054533)\n- Breast Neoplasms (D001943)\n- Cell Proliferation (D002466)\n- Apoptosis (D017209)\n- Cell Adhesion (D015815)\n- Necrosis (D009336)\n- Cell Movement (D002465)\n\nPutting it all together. Make sure no extra spaces in terms. Capitalization as per the ontologies. For example, \"Necrosis\" in GO is \"necrotic cell death\", but in MeSH it's \"Necrosis\". \n\nDouble-check all IDs:\n\nCL:0000182 is correct for mammary epithelial cells.\nGO terms: 0008283 (cell proliferation), 0006915 (apoptotic process), 0007155 (cell adhesion), 0070269 (necrotic cell death), 0016477 (cell motility).\nMeSH: D054533 (Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast), D001943 (Breast Neoplasms), D002466 (Cell Proliferation), D017209 (Apoptosis), D015815 (Cell Adhesion), D009336 (Necrosis), D002465 (Cell Movement).\n\nYes, that's correct. Now structure the JSON accordingly, ensuring categories are exact and arrays are properly formatted.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000182\",\n            \"term\": \"mammary epithelial cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0008283\",\n            \"term\": \"cell proliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0006915\",\n            \"term\": \"apoptotic process\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007155\",\n            \"term\": \"cell adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0070269\",\n            \"term\": \"necrotic cell death\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0016477\",\n            \"term\": \"cell motility\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D054533\",\n            \"term\": \"Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D001943\",\n            \"term\": \"Breast Neoplasms\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002466\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Proliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D017209\",\n            \"term\": \"Apoptosis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D015815\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D009336\",\n            \"term\": \"Necrosis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002465\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Movement\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"
