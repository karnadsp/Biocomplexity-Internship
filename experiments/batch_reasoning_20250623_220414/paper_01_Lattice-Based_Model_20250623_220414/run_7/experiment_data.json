Pathologists characterize DCIS by four tissue morphologies (micropapillary, cribriform, solid, and comedo), but the underlying mechanisms that distinguish the development and progression of these morphologies are not well understood. Here we explored the conditions leading to the emergence of the different morphologies of DCIS using a two-dimensional multi-cell lattice-based model that incorporates cell proliferation, apoptosis, necrosis, adhesion, and contractility. We found that the relative rates of cell proliferation and apoptosis governed which of the four morphologies emerged. High proliferation and low apoptosis favored the emergence of solid and comedo morphologies. In contrast, low proliferation and high apoptosis led to the micropapillary morphology, whereas high proliferation and high apoptosis led to the cribriform morphology. The natural progression between morphologies cannot be investigated in vivo since lesions are usually surgically removed upon detection; however, our model suggests probable transitions between these morphologies during breast cancer progression. Importantly, cribriform and comedo appear to be the ultimate morphologies of DCIS. Motivated by previous experimental studies demonstrating that tumor cells behave differently depending on where they are located within the mammary duct in vivo or in engineered tissues, we examined the effects of tissue geometry on the progression of DCIS. In agreement with our previous experimental work, we found that cells are more likely to invade from the end of ducts and that this preferential invasion is regulated by cell adhesion and contractility. This model provides additional insight into tumor cell behavior and allows the exploration of phenotypic transitions not easily monitored in vivo."

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this request. The user wants structured ontology annotations based on the provided description of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and the model used to study it. The goal is to map the biological concepts mentioned to the appropriate Cell Ontology (CL), Gene Ontology (GO), and MeSH terms.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original description thoroughly. The main entities mentioned are DCIS, mammary epithelial cells, the four morphologies (micropapillary, cribriform, solid, comedo), processes like cell proliferation, apoptosis, necrosis, adhesion, contractility, and concepts like tumor invasion and tissue geometry.\n\nStarting with CellOntology. The key cell type here is mammary epithelial cells. The correct CL term for that is \"CL:0002492\" with the term \"Mammary Epithelial Cell\". Also, since DCIS involves abnormal proliferation, maybe neoplastic cells. But the description specifies mammary epithelial cells, so I'll stick with that. Let me check if there's a CL term for neoplastic cells. CL has \"CL:0008032\" for neoplastic cell. But the original text specifically mentions \"mammary epithelial cells\" so including both might be better. Wait, the user said to include relevant terms. So both could be applicable here.\n\nNext, GeneOntology. The processes mentioned are cell proliferation (GO:0008283), apoptosis (GO:0006915), necrosis (GO:0070269), cell adhesion (GO:0007155), and contractility. Contractility could refer to cell contractility, which is GO:0031267. Also, the model involves cell division, but cell proliferation is already covered. The model itself is a lattice-based model, but that's a method, not a GO term. GO terms are about biological processes, molecular functions, or cellular components. So the main processes are the ones listed.\n\nFor MeSH terms, the main topics are DCIS itself, which is MeSH D054490. Other concepts: cell proliferation (MeSH D002460), apoptosis (MeSH D017209), necrosis (D009336), cell adhesion (D015815), contractility (D003325), and breast neoplasms (D001943). Also, mammary ducts might be part of breast anatomy, but MeSH terms for that could be \"Mammary Glands, Human\" (D008369). Tissue geometry isn't a MeSH term, but morphogenesis (D009048) might relate to the development of morphologies. Tumor invasion is covered by \"Neoplasm Invasiveness\" (D009361).\n\nNow, checking the exact term names and IDs. For CellOntology:\n- Mammary Epithelial Cell: CL:0002492\n- Neoplastic Cell: CL:0008032\n\nGeneOntology:\n- Cell proliferation: GO:0008283\n- Apoptotic process: GO:0006915\n- Necrosis: GO:0070269\n- Cell adhesion: GO:0007155\n- Cell contractility: GO:0031267\n\nMeSH:\n- Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating: D054490 (this is DCIS)\n- Cell Proliferation: D002460\n- Apoptosis: D017209\n- Necrosis: D009336\n- Cell Adhesion: D015815\n- Cell Contractility: D003325\n- Breast Neoplasms: D001943\n- Neoplasm Invasiveness: D009361\n- Morphogenesis: D009048 (since the study talks about morphology development)\n\nWait, \"contractility\" in MeSH is D003325, which is \"Muscle Contraction\", but cell contractility might not be directly covered. Alternatively, check if there's a MeSH term for cell contractility. Hmm, maybe \"Cellular Contractility\" is a term, but MeSH might not have that exact term. Let me verify. Searching MeSH, \"Contractility\" as a concept might be under \"Cell Movement\" (D002465) or \"Cell Physiological Phenomena\" (D002468). Alternatively, maybe \"Cell Contraction\" (D017207). Yes, \"Cell Contraction\" is MeSH D017207. So I should use that instead of D003325. So correcting that.\n\nSo for MeSH contractility, the correct term is \"Cell Contraction\" with ID D017207.\n\nSimilarly, tissue geometry isn't a MeSH term, but since the study mentions effects of tissue geometry on progression, maybe \"Extracellular Matrix\" (D005109) or \"Tissue Scaffolds\" (D058426), but those don't fit exactly. Alternatively, \"Models, Biological\" (D008954) but the user might prefer more specific terms. The study uses a lattice-based model, but that's a computational model. Maybe \"Computer Simulation\" (D003196), but the user didn't mention computational methods in the example. Since the original example included terms directly mentioned, maybe focus on the biological aspects. Since the answer should include only the applicable terms from the text, perhaps morphogenesis (D009048) is relevant as the model explores the emergence of morphologies.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nCellOntology:\n- Mammary Epithelial Cell (CL:0002492)\n- Neoplastic Cell (CL:0008032)\n\nGeneOntology:\n- Cell proliferation (GO:0008283)\n- Apoptotic process (GO:0006915)\n- Necrosis (GO:0070269)\n- Cell adhesion (GO:0007155)\n- Cell contractility (GO:0031267)\n\nMeSH:\n- Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating (D054490)\n- Cell Proliferation (D002460)\n- Apoptosis (D017209)\n- Necrosis (D009336)\n- Cell Adhesion (D015815)\n- Cell Contraction (D017207)\n- Breast Neoplasms (D001943)\n- Neoplasm Invasiveness (D009361)\n- Morphogenesis (D009048)\n\nCheck if all terms are exact and IDs are correctly formatted. For example, \"Apoptotic process\" is the term for GO:0006915, but the MeSH term is \"Apoptosis\". The user specified exact term names. So yes, \"Apoptotic process\" for GO and \"Apoptosis\" for MeSH.\n\nMake sure no extra spaces in IDs or terms. All looks good.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0002492\",\n            \"term\": \"Mammary Epithelial Cell\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0008032\",\n            \"term\": \"Neoplastic Cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0008283\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Proliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0006915\",\n            \"term\": \"Apoptotic Process\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0070269\",\n            \"term\": \"Necrosis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007155\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0031267\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Contractility\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D054490\",\n            \"term\": \"Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002460\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Proliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D017209\",\n            \"term\": \"Apoptosis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D009336\",\n            \"term\": \"Necrosis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D015815\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D017207\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Contraction\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D001943\",\n            \"term\": \"Breast Neoplasms\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D009361\",\n            \"term\": \"Neoplasm Invasiveness\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D009048\",\n            \"term\": \"Morphogenesis\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```"

Basic cell types and parameters based on the ontology annotations",
      "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a CompuCell3D simulation Python file based on the provided ontology annotations. Let's start by recalling the structure of a typical CompuCell3D script.\n\nFirst, the necessary imports: CompuCellSetup and the steppables module. Those are standard. Then, the simulation class that inherits from SteppableBasePy. The class should have __init__, start, and step methods.\n\nThe ontology annotations mention two cell types: Mammary Epithelial Cell and Neoplastic Cell. So I'll define those in the start method using self.cellTypeDict. The Gene Ontology terms include processes like adhesion, apoptosis, contractility, necrosis, and proliferation. MeSH terms add more context like breast neoplasms and morphogenesis.\n\nIn the simulation parameters, I should set contact energies between the cell types. Maybe also volume parameters. For the step method, I'll implement basic checks for apoptosis and necrosis. For apoptosis, if a cell's volume is below a threshold, I can kill it. For necrosis, maybe check volume or another condition and change the target volume to simulate swelling.\n\nCell proliferation can be handled by checking if a cell's volume exceeds a threshold and then dividing. But the user might want a simple example, so maybe just a basic mitosis example.\n\nWait, in CompuCell3D, cell division is often handled via the MitosisSteppable, but since the user wants everything in one steppable, maybe I'll use the built-in functions. Alternatively, in the step method, check if volume is high enough and call divideCell.\n\nAlso, need to register the steppable with CompuCellSetup. That's done by instantiating the simulation class and passing it to registerSteppable.\n\nLet me outline the code structure:\n\n1. Imports: CompuCellSetup, steppables, and maybe some modules like random.\n\n2. Simulation class inheriting from SteppableBasePy.\n\n3. In __init__, call the parent __init__.\n\n4. In start method, define cell types, set up contact energy matrix, and initialize cell parameters like target volume, lambda volume, etc.\n\n5. In step method, loop through cells, check for apoptosis (maybe if volume too low), necrosis (maybe set a flag and change target volume), and proliferation (check volume and divide).\n\nWait, but for apoptosis, CompuCell3D has a built-in way to mark cells for death. So in the step method, if a cell's volume is below a threshold, set cell.targetVolume = 0 and cell.lambdaVolume = 0, then call cellDict.removeCell(cell). Alternatively, use the killCell function.\n\nFor necrosis, perhaps changing the target volume to cause swelling, or changing the cell type to a necrotic type with different properties.\n\nBut since the ontology includes both apoptosis and necrosis, I need to handle both. Maybe set a probability or a condition based on volume.\n\nFor cell proliferation, check if a cell's volume is above a certain threshold and then divide. Using the divideCell function.\n\nAlso, contact energies between cell types need to be set in the start method. Like setting up a contact matrix between epithelial, neoplastic, and medium.\n\nWait, the medium is usually type 0. So in the contact energy matrix, I need to include all types.\n\nNow, let's code:\n\n- In start, after defining cell types (epithelial and neoplastic), set contact energies using the potts object. For example:\n\nself.potts.setContactEnergy(\"MammaryEpithelial\", \"MammaryEpithelial\", 10)\nself.potts.setContactEnergy(\"MammaryEpithelial\", \"Neoplastic\", 15)\nself.potts.setContactEnergy(\"Neoplastic\", \"Neoplastic\", 10)\nself.potts.setContactEnergy(\"MammaryEpithelial\", \"Medium\", 20)\nself.potts.setContactEnergy(\"Neoplastic\", \"Medium\", 20)\n\nBut I need to check the correct syntax. Also, the order might matter.\n\nFor cell parameters, in start, initialize cells. Maybe create a few cells of each type. But perhaps the user expects initial cell setup, but since the problem doesn't specify, maybe skip that and let the user add cells via XML or another method. Alternatively, create a simple initial cell.\n\nAlternatively, the code might not include initial cell placement, just parameters. So in the start method, set target volume and lambda volume for each cell type.\n\nWait, but each cell's parameters can be set in the start method. For example:\n\nfor cell in self.cellList:\n    cell.targetVolume = 25\n    cell.lambdaVolume = 2.0\n\nBut maybe set default parameters for each cell type. Alternatively, in the simulation class, set parameters based on cell type.\n\nBut since the code needs to be basic, perhaps set the parameters in the start method for all cells. Alternatively, use the cell types to set different parameters.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nImports:\n\nfrom pyrcell3d import CompuCellSetup\nfrom PySteppables import SteppableBasePy\n\nWait, CompuCell3D typically uses:\n\nimport CompuCellSetup\nfrom PySteppables import SteppableBasePy\n\nThen, the simulation class.\n\nIn __init__:\n\ndef __init__(self, _simulator, _frequency=1):\n    SteppableBasePy.__init__(self, _simulator, _frequency)\n\nIn start:\n\ndef start(self):\n    self.cellTypeDict = {\n        \"MammaryEpithelial\": self.addCellType(\"MammaryEpithelial\"),\n        \"Neoplastic\": self.addCellType(\"Neoplastic\"),\n        \"Medium\": self.addCellType(\"Medium\")\n    }\n    self.potts.setContactEnergy(\"MammaryEpithelial\", \"MammaryEpithelial\", 10)\n    self.potts.setContactEnergy(\"Neoplastic\", \"Neoplastic\", 10)\n    self.potts.setContactEnergy(\"MammaryEpithelial\", \"Neoplastic\", 15)\n    self.potts.setContactEnergy(\"MammaryEpithelial\", \"Medium\", 16)\n    self.potts.setContactEnergy(\"Neoplastic\", \"Medium\", 16)\n    \n    # Set volume parameters\n    for cell in self.cellList:\n        cell.targetVolume = 25\n        cell.lambdaVolume = 2.0\n        # Different parameters for neoplastic cells?\n        if cell.type == self.cellTypeDict[\"Neoplastic\"]:\n            cell.targetVolume = 30\n            cell.lambdaVolume = 1.5\n\nWait, but if there are no initial cells, this loop won't do anything. Maybe the user is expected to add cells via an initial configuration in another file. Since the problem says to return only the Python code, perhaps the initial cells are not part of this script. So maybe skip that part.\n\nAlternatively, create a few initial cells. For example, create a cluster of epithelial and neoplastic cells. But how?\n\nIn the start method, using self.potts.createCell() functions. Maybe:\n\ncell = self.potts.createCell()\ncell.type = self.cellTypeDict[\"MammaryEpithelial\"]\nself.cellList.append(cell)\n\nBut I need to position them. Maybe using a blob initializer. But without knowing the specifics, perhaps it's better to omit initial cell creation and focus on parameters.\n\nIn the step method:\n\ndef step(self, mcs):\n    for cell in self.cellList:\n        # Apoptosis (volume too low)\n        if cell.volume < 15:\n            self.killCell(cell)\n        # Necrosis (maybe volume too high, change type or parameters)\n        elif cell.volume > 50:\n            cell.type = self.cellTypeDict[\"Necrotic\"]  # But necrotic isn't a defined type here\n            # Alternatively, mark as necrotic by changing target volume\n            cell.targetVolume = 100\n            cell.lambdaVolume = 0.5\n        # Proliferation\n        elif cell.volume > 30:\n            self.divideCell(cell, 1, 0)  # Divide along x-axis\n\nWait, but the ontology mentions Necrosis (GO:0070269) and MeSH term for Necrosis. So perhaps I need a separate cell type for necrotic cells? But the original CellOntology has only two types. Maybe the Neoplastic cells can become necrotic. Or introduce a new type.\n\nWait, the CellOntology provided has 'Mammary Epithelial Cell' and 'Neoplastic Cell'. So perhaps necrosis is a process that affects existing cells, changing their properties. So in the code, when a cell undergoes necrosis, maybe change its type to a necrotic type. But since the ontology didn't list necrotic as a cell type, perhaps handle it by changing parameters.\n\nAlternatively, create a Necrotic cell type as part of the simulation, even if not in the original CellOntology. But the user specified the ontology annotations, which include 'Necrosis' in GeneOntology and MeSH. So maybe it's a process, not a cell type. So in the step method, check conditions and apply necrosis effects.\n\nAlternatively, when a cell's volume is too high, trigger necrosis by altering its parameters. For example, set targetVolume higher and lambdaVolume lower to simulate swelling and eventual lysis.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let's keep it simple. For apoptosis, if volume is below a threshold, kill the cell. For necrosis, if some condition (maybe time or another volume threshold),"

So the main processes are the ones listed.\n\nFor MeSH terms, the main topics are DCIS itself, which is MeSH D054490. Other concepts: cell proliferation (MeSH D002460), apoptosis (MeSH D017209), necrosis (D009336), cell adhesion (D015815), contractility (D003325), and breast neoplasms (D001943). Also, mammary ducts might be part of breast anatomy, but MeSH terms for that could be \"Mammary Glands, Human\" (D008369). Tissue geometry isn't a MeSH term, but morphogenesis (D009048) might relate to the development of morphologies. Tumor invasion is covered by \"Neoplasm Invasiveness\" (D009361).\n\nNow, checking the exact term names and IDs. For CellOntology:\n- Mammary Epithelial Cell: CL:0002492\n- Neoplastic Cell: CL:0008032\n\nGeneOntology:\n- Cell proliferation: GO:0008283\n- Apoptotic process: GO:0006915\n- Necrosis: GO:0070269\n- Cell adhesion: GO:0007155\n- Cell contractility: GO:0031267\n\nMeSH:\n- Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating: D054490 (this is DCIS)\n- Cell Proliferation: D002460\n- Apoptosis: D017209\n- Necrosis: D009336\n- Cell Adhesion: D015815\n- Cell Contractility: D003325\n- Breast Neoplasms: D001943\n- Neoplasm Invasiveness: D009361\n- Morphogenesis: D009048 (since the study talks about morphology development)\n\nWait, \"contractility\" in MeSH is D003325, which is \"Muscle Contraction\", but cell contractility might not be directly covered. Alternatively, check if there's a MeSH term for cell contractility. Hmm, maybe \"Cellular Contractility\" is a term, but MeSH might not have that exact term. Let me verify. Searching MeSH, \"Contractility\" as a concept might be under \"Cell Movement\" (D002465) or \"Cell Physiological Phenomena\" (D002468). Alternatively, maybe \"Cell Contraction\" (D017207). Yes, \"Cell Contraction\" is MeSH D017207. So I should use that instead of D003325. So correcting that.\n\nSo for MeSH contractility, the correct term is \"Cell Contraction\" with ID D017207.\n\nSimilarly, tissue geometry isn't a MeSH term, but since the study mentions effects of tissue geometry on progression, maybe \"Extracellular Matrix\" (D005109) or \"Tissue Scaffolds\" (D058426), but those don't fit exactly. Alternatively, \"Models, Biological\" (D008954) but the user might prefer more specific terms. The study uses a lattice-based model, but that's a computational model. Maybe \"Computer Simulation\" (D003196), but the user didn't mention computational methods in the example. Since the original example included terms directly mentioned, maybe focus on the biological aspects. Since the answer should include only the applicable terms from the text, perhaps morphogenesis (D009048) is relevant as the model explores the emergence of morphologies.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nCellOntology:\n- Mammary Epithelial Cell (CL:0002492)\n- Neoplastic Cell (CL:0008032)\n\nGeneOntology:\n- Cell proliferation (GO:0008283)\n- Apoptotic process (GO:0006915)\n- Necrosis (GO:0070269)\n- Cell adhesion (GO:0007155)\n- Cell contractility (GO:0031267)\n\nMeSH:\n- Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating (D054490)\n- Cell Proliferation (D002460)\n- Apoptosis (D017209)\n- Necrosis (D009336)\n- Cell Adhesion (D015815)\n- Cell Contraction (D017207)\n- Breast Neoplasms (D001943)\n- Neoplasm Invasiveness (D009361)\n- Morphogenesis (D009048)\n\nCheck if all terms are exact and IDs are correctly formatted. For example, \"Apoptotic process\" is the term for GO:0006915, but the MeSH term is \"Apoptosis\". The user specified exact term names. So yes, \"Apoptotic process\" for GO and \"Apoptosis\" for MeSH.\n\nMake sure no extra spaces in IDs or terms. All looks good.\n</think>",

      "python_code": "from cc3d.core.PySteppables import *\n\n<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a CompuCell3D simulation Python file based on the provided ontology annotations. Let's start by recalling the structure of a typical CompuCell3D script.\n\nFirst, the necessary imports: CompuCellSetup and the steppables module. Those are standard. Then, the simulation class that inherits from SteppableBasePy. The class should have __init__, start, and step methods.\n\nThe ontology annotations mention two cell types: Mammary Epithelial Cell and Neoplastic Cell. So I'll define those in the start method using self.cellTypeDict. The Gene Ontology terms include processes like adhesion, apoptosis, contractility, necrosis, and proliferation. MeSH terms add more context like breast neoplasms and morphogenesis.\n\nIn the simulation parameters, I should set contact energies between the cell types. Maybe also volume parameters. For the step method, I'll implement basic checks for apoptosis and necrosis. For apoptosis, if a cell's volume is below a threshold, I can kill it. For necrosis, maybe check volume or another condition and change the target volume to simulate swelling.\n\nCell proliferation can be handled by checking if a cell's volume exceeds a threshold and then dividing. But the user might want a simple example, so maybe just a basic mitosis example.\n\nWait, in CompuCell3D, cell division is often handled via the MitosisSteppable, but since the user wants everything in one steppable, maybe I'll use the built-in functions. Alternatively, in the step method, check if volume is high enough and call divideCell.\n\nAlso, need to register the steppable with CompuCellSetup. That's done by instantiating the simulation class and passing it to registerSteppable.\n\nLet me outline the code structure:\n\n1. Imports: CompuCellSetup, steppables, and maybe some modules like random.\n\n2. Simulation class inheriting from SteppableBasePy.\n\n3. In __init__, call the parent __init__.\n\n4. In start method, define cell types, set up contact energy matrix, and initialize cell parameters like target volume, lambda volume, etc.\n\n5. In step method, loop through cells, check for apoptosis (maybe if volume too low), necrosis (maybe set a flag and change target volume), and proliferation (check volume and divide).\n\nWait, but for apoptosis, CompuCell3D has a built-in way to mark cells for death. So in the step method, if a cell's volume is below a threshold, set cell.targetVolume = 0 and cell.lambdaVolume = 0, then call cellDict.removeCell(cell). Alternatively, use the killCell function.\n\nFor necrosis, perhaps changing the target volume to cause swelling, or changing the cell type to a necrotic type with different properties.\n\nBut since the ontology includes both apoptosis and necrosis, I need to handle both. Maybe set a probability or a condition based on volume.\n\nFor cell proliferation, check if a cell's volume is above a certain threshold and then divide. Using the divideCell function.\n\nAlso, contact energies between cell types need to be set in the start method. Like setting up a contact matrix between epithelial, neoplastic, and medium.\n\nWait, the medium is usually type 0. So in the contact energy matrix, I need to include all types.\n\nNow, let's code:\n\n- In start, after defining cell types (epithelial and neoplastic), set contact energies using the potts object. For example:\n\nself.potts.setContactEnergy(\"MammaryEpithelial\", \"MammaryEpithelial\", 10)\nself.potts.setContactEnergy(\"MammaryEpithelial\", \"Neoplastic\", 15)\nself.potts.setContactEnergy(\"Neoplastic\", \"Neoplastic\", 10)\nself.potts.setContactEnergy(\"MammaryEpithelial\", \"Medium\", 20)\nself.potts.setContactEnergy(\"Neoplastic\", \"Medium\", 20)\n\nBut I need to check the correct syntax. Also, the order might matter.\n\nFor cell parameters, in start, initialize cells. Maybe create a few cells of each type. But perhaps the user expects initial cell setup, but since the problem doesn't specify, maybe skip that and let the user add cells via XML or another method. Alternatively, create a simple initial cell.\n\nAlternatively, the code might not include initial cell placement, just parameters. So in the start method, set target volume and lambda volume for each cell type.\n\nWait, but each cell's parameters can be set in the start method. For example:\n\nfor cell in self.cellList:\n    cell.targetVolume = 25\n    cell.lambdaVolume = 2.0\n\nBut maybe set default parameters for each cell type. Alternatively, in the simulation class, set parameters based on cell type.\n\nBut since the code needs to be basic, perhaps set the parameters in the start method for all cells. Alternatively, use the cell types to set different parameters.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nImports:\n\nfrom pyrcell3d import CompuCellSetup\nfrom PySteppables import SteppableBasePy\n\nWait, CompuCell3D typically uses:\n\nimport CompuCellSetup\nfrom PySteppables import SteppableBasePy\n\nThen, the simulation class.\n\nIn __init__:\n\ndef __init__(self, _simulator, _frequency=1):\n    SteppableBasePy.__init__(self, _simulator, _frequency)\n\nIn start:\n\ndef start(self):\n    self.cellTypeDict = {\n        \"MammaryEpithelial\": self.addCellType(\"MammaryEpithelial\"),\n        \"Neoplastic\": self.addCellType(\"Neoplastic\"),\n        \"Medium\": self.addCellType(\"Medium\")\n    }\n    self.potts.setContactEnergy(\"MammaryEpithelial\", \"MammaryEpithelial\", 10)\n    self.potts.setContactEnergy(\"Neoplastic\", \"Neoplastic\", 10)\n    self.potts.setContactEnergy(\"MammaryEpithelial\", \"Neoplastic\", 15)\n    self.potts.setContactEnergy(\"MammaryEpithelial\", \"Medium\", 16)\n    self.potts.setContactEnergy(\"Neoplastic\", \"Medium\", 16)\n    \n    # Set volume parameters\n    for cell in self.cellList:\n        cell.targetVolume = 25\n        cell.lambdaVolume = 2.0\n        # Different parameters for neoplastic cells?\n        if cell.type == self.cellTypeDict[\"Neoplastic\"]:\n            cell.targetVolume = 30\n            cell.lambdaVolume = 1.5\n\nWait, but if there are no initial cells, this loop won't do anything. Maybe the user is expected to add cells via an initial configuration in another file. Since the problem says to return only the Python code, perhaps the initial cells are not part of this script. So maybe skip that part.\n\nAlternatively, create a few initial cells. For example, create a cluster of epithelial and neoplastic cells. But how?\n\nIn the start method, using self.potts.createCell() functions. Maybe:\n\ncell = self.potts.createCell()\ncell.type = self.cellTypeDict[\"MammaryEpithelial\"]\nself.cellList.append(cell)\n\nBut I need to position them. Maybe using a blob initializer. But without knowing the specifics, perhaps it's better to omit initial cell creation and focus on parameters.\n\nIn the step method:\n\ndef step(self, mcs):\n    for cell in self.cellList:\n        # Apoptosis (volume too low)\n        if cell.volume < 15:\n            self.killCell(cell)\n        # Necrosis (maybe volume too high, change type or parameters)\n        elif cell.volume > 50:\n            cell.type = self.cellTypeDict[\"Necrotic\"]  # But necrotic isn't a defined type here\n            # Alternatively, mark as necrotic by changing target volume\n            cell.targetVolume = 100\n            cell.lambdaVolume = 0.5\n        # Proliferation\n        elif cell.volume > 30:\n            self.divideCell(cell, 1, 0)  # Divide along x-axis\n\nWait, but the ontology mentions Necrosis (GO:0070269) and MeSH term for Necrosis. So perhaps I need a separate cell type for necrotic cells? But the original CellOntology has only two types. Maybe the Neoplastic cells can become necrotic. Or introduce a new type.\n\nWait, the CellOntology provided has 'Mammary Epithelial Cell' and 'Neoplastic Cell'. So perhaps necrosis is a process that affects existing cells, changing their properties. So in the code, when a cell undergoes necrosis, maybe change its type to a necrotic type. But since the ontology didn't list necrotic as a cell type, perhaps handle it by changing parameters.\n\nAlternatively, create a Necrotic cell type as part of the simulation, even if not in the original CellOntology. But the user specified the ontology annotations, which include 'Necrosis' in GeneOntology and MeSH. So maybe it's a process, not a cell type. So in the step method, check conditions and apply necrosis effects.\n\nAlternatively, when a cell's volume is too high, trigger necrosis by altering its parameters. For example, set targetVolume higher and lambdaVolume lower to simulate swelling and eventual lysis.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let's keep it simple. For apoptosis, if volume is below a threshold, kill the cell. For necrosis, if some condition (maybe time or another volume threshold),",
