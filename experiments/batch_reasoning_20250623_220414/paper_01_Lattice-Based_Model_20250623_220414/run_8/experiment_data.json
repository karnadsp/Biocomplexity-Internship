Pathologists characterize DCIS by four tissue morphologies (micropapillary, cribriform, solid, and comedo), but the underlying mechanisms that distinguish the development and progression of these morphologies are not well understood. Here we explored the conditions leading to the emergence of the different morphologies of DCIS using a two-dimensional multi-cell lattice-based model that incorporates cell proliferation, apoptosis, necrosis, adhesion, and contractility. We found that the relative rates of cell proliferation and apoptosis governed which of the four morphologies emerged. High proliferation and low apoptosis favored the emergence of solid and comedo morphologies. In contrast, low proliferation and high apoptosis led to the micropapillary morphology, whereas high proliferation and high apoptosis led to the cribriform morphology. The natural progression between morphologies cannot be investigated in vivo since lesions are usually surgically removed upon detection; however, our model suggests probable transitions between these morphologies during breast cancer progression. Importantly, cribriform and comedo appear to be the ultimate morphologies of DCIS. Motivated by previous experimental studies demonstrating that tumor cells behave differently depending on where they are located within the mammary duct in vivo or in engineered tissues, we examined the effects of tissue geometry on the progression of DCIS. In agreement with our previous experimental work, we found that cells are more likely to invade from the end of ducts and that this preferential invasion is regulated by cell adhesion and contractility.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create structured ontology annotations for the provided DCIS study. Let's start by breaking down the information given.\n\nFirst, the main focus is on ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), which involves abnormal proliferation of mammary epithelial cells. So CellOntology should include mammary epithelial cells. Checking the Cell Ontology, the correct ID for mammary epithelial cells is CL:0002492.\n\nNext, GeneOntology terms. The model incorporates processes like cell proliferation, apoptosis, necrosis, adhesion, and contractility. For cell proliferation, the GO term is \"cell population proliferation\" with ID GO:0008283. Apoptosis is GO:0006915. Cell adhesion is GO:0007155, and cell-matrix adhesion might be relevant here, which is GO:0007160. Contractility isn't a direct GO term, but \"actomyosin structure organization\" (GO:0031032) could relate to contractility mechanisms. Necrosis is part of the cell death processes, so \"necrotic cell death\" (GO:0070269) should be included.\n\nFor MeSH terms, the main topics are ductal carcinoma in situ, which is MeSH D054948. Breast neoplasms are D001943. Cell proliferation (D002466), apoptosis (D017209), and necrosis (D009336) are also relevant. Cell adhesion (D002448) and cell movement (D002465) might be applicable given the invasion aspects mentioned. Tissue engineering (D019738) is mentioned in the context of engineered tissues influencing cell behavior.\n\nI need to ensure that category names are exact: CellOntology, GeneOntology, MeSH. Check IDs for correct formatting without spaces. Terms should be exactly as per ontology, like \"mammary epithelial cell\" for CL term. Also, verify that all terms match the correct IDs. No extra terms or typos. Make sure all the key processes from the description are covered. Avoid adding terms not explicitly mentioned but implied. For example, actomyosin organization is linked to contractility. The model explores transitions between morphologies, but maybe that's more about the processes like proliferation and apoptosis rather than specific GO terms for morphology. Tissue geometry effects relate to adhesion and contractility, so MeSH terms for cell movement and adhesion are appropriate. Double-check each ID and term spelling to match exactly.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0002492\",\n            \"term\": \"mammary epithelial cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0008283\",\n            \"term\": \"cell population proliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0006915\",\n            \"term\": \"apoptotic process\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0070269\",\n            \"term\": \"necrotic cell death\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007155\",\n            \"term\": \"cell adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0031032\",\n            \"term\": \"actomyosin structure organization\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007160\",\n            \"term\": \"cell-matrix adhesion\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D054948\",\n            \"term\": \"Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D001943\",\n            \"term\": \"Breast Neoplasms\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002466\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Proliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D017209\",\n            \"term\": \"Apoptosis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D009336\",\n            \"term\": \"Necrosis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002448\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002465\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Movement\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D019738\",\n            \"term\": \"Tissue Engineering\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"

The user wants Python code with specific components: imports, a simulation class inheriting from SteppableBasePy, __init__, start, and step methods, and basic cell types and parameters based on the provided ontology.\n\nFirst, the necessary imports. CompuCellSetup and steppables are required. So I'll import those. Also, I might need to import modules like cc3d for core functionalities.\n\nNext, the simulation class. It should inherit from steppables.SteppableBasePy. The class needs __init__, start, and step methods. In the __init__ method, I'll make sure to call the parent class's __init__ using super().\n\nLooking at the ontology annotations, the cell type is mammary epithelial cell. So I'll define that as a cell type in the start method using self.cell_type. The GeneOntology terms include proliferation, adhesion, necrotic death, actomyosin organization, apoptosis, and cell-matrix adhesion. MeSH terms add concepts like proliferation, necrosis, apoptosis, adhesion, movement, and breast neoplasms.\n\nFor cell parameters, I should set properties related to adhesion, volume, and death. Maybe set target volume and lambda volume for volume constraints. For adhesion, define adhesion energies between cells and the medium. Also, include parameters for necrosis and apoptosis, like necrosis threshold and apoptosis time.\n\nIn the start method, I'll initialize the cell types and set up the simulation. The step method can handle processes like apoptosis and necrosis. For example, check each cell's volume: if it's too low, maybe trigger necrosis. Or track time for apoptosis.\n\nWait, the apoptosis process in the ontology suggests that cells might undergo programmed death. So in the step method, I can iterate over each cell, increment a counter, and if it exceeds a threshold, mark the cell as dead. Similarly, for necrosis, check if the volume drops below a certain level and change the type to necrotic.\n\nI should also set up the contact energy between cells and the medium. Maybe set adhesion energy for the cell type to medium to a certain value. Also, include parameters for cell movement, possibly by setting fluctuation amplitudes.\n\nLet me structure the code step by step. Start with the imports, then create the simulation class. In the start method, define the cell types (mammary epithelial, maybe necrotic and apoptotic as separate types). Set their properties like target volume, adhesion energy, etc. In the step method, loop through cells each step, check their volume for necrosis, track time for apoptosis.\n\nI should also make sure to register the steppable with CompuCellSetup at the end. Testing parameters like steps might be set, but the user didn't specify, so just a basic structure.\n\nDouble-checking if all ontology terms are addressed.
