        "description": "Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a heterogeneous group of non-invasive lesions of the breast that result from abnormal proliferation of mammary epithelial cells. Pathologists characterize DCIS by four tissue morphologies (micropapillary, cribriform, solid, and comedo), but the underlying mechanisms that distinguish the development and progression of these morphologies are not well understood. Here we explored the conditions leading to the emergence of the different morphologies of DCIS using a two-dimensional multi-cell lattice-based model that incorporates cell proliferation, apoptosis, necrosis, adhesion, and contractility. We found that the relative rates of cell proliferation and apoptosis governed which of the four morphologies emerged. High proliferation and low apoptosis favored the emergence of solid and comedo morphologies. In contrast, low proliferation and high apoptosis led to the micropapillary morphology, whereas high proliferation and high apoptosis led to the cribriform morphology. The natural progression between morphologies cannot be investigated in vivo since lesions are usually surgically removed upon detection; however, our model suggests probable transitions between these morphologies during breast cancer progression. Importantly, cribriform and comedo appear to be the ultimate morphologies of DCIS. Motivated by previous experimental studies demonstrating that tumor cells behave differently depending on where they are located within the mammary duct in vivo or in engineered tissues, we examined the effects of tissue geometry on the progression of DCIS. In agreement with our previous experimental work, we found that cells are more likely to invade from the end of ducts and that this preferential invasion is regulated by cell adhesion and contractility. This model provides additional insight into tumor cell behavior and allows the exploration of phenotypic transitions not easily monitored in vivo."

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this request. The user wants structured ontology annotations for the given description of Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) using Cell Ontology, Gene Ontology, and MeSH terms.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original description to identify relevant terms. The main focus is on DCIS, mammary epithelial cells, processes like proliferation, apoptosis, necrosis, adhesion, contractility, and concepts like tumor invasion and tissue geometry.\n\nStarting with CellOntology. The text mentions \"mammary epithelial cells\". Checking Cell Ontology, the correct term for mammary epithelial cells is \"CL:0002504\" with the term \"Epithelial Cell of Mammary Gland\". So that's one entry. Also, since DCIS is a type of carcinoma in situ, maybe there's a specific cell type for that? But looking at CL, I don't see a direct term for DCIS cells. Maybe stick with the epithelial cells mentioned.\n\nNext, GeneOntology. The processes listed are proliferation (GO:0008283 for cell proliferation), apoptosis (GO:0006915 for apoptotic process), necrosis (GO:0070269 for necroptosis), cell adhesion (GO:0007155 for cell adhesion), and contractility. Contractility might be \"muscle contraction\" but that's too specific. Alternatively, \"cell contraction\" is GO:0045214. Wait, but the model includes contractility in general, so maybe \"cellular process\" is too broad. Alternatively, \"actin-mediated cell contraction\" is GO:0032154. Hmm, but the text just says \"contractility\". Maybe \"cell motility\" (GO:0016477) or \"regulation of cell shape\" (GO:0008360)? Alternatively, check if there's a more precise term. Let me verify. Contractility could relate to actomyosin contractility, which is part of cellular processes. Maybe \"actomyosin structure organization\" (GO:0031032) or \"regulation of actin cytoskeleton organization\" (GO:0032956). Alternatively, if the model is referring to cell contractility as part of movement or adhesion, maybe \"cell-cell adhesion\" (GO:0016337). Wait, the model mentions adhesion and contractility as separate factors. So for adhesion, the correct GO term is \"cell adhesion\" (GO:0007155). For contractility, perhaps \"cell contraction\" (GO:0045214). Need to confirm the exact term. Looking up GO:0045214, it's \"maintenance of cell polarity involved in maintenance of apical/basal cell polarity\", which might not be it. Alternatively, \"cell motility\" (GO:0016477) is a broader term. Alternatively, \"cell-substrate adhesion\" (GO:0031589). Hmm. Maybe \"cell migration\" (GO:0016477) is under cell motility. But contractility is more about the ability to contract. Another possibility: \"cellular contractile fiber\" (GO:0043292) is a cellular component. Maybe not. Alternatively, \"muscle contraction\" is GO:0006936, but that's specific to muscle cells. Since the context is epithelial cells, perhaps \"cell contraction\" is the right term, but I need to check the exact ID. Alternatively, maybe there isn't a direct term, but the process here is part of cell motility or adhesion. Alternatively, the contractility here refers to cytoskeletal changes. \"Regulation of cytoskeleton organization\" (GO:0051493). Hmm. Alternatively, \"cell morphogenesis\" (GO:0000902). Since the model is looking at how cells change shape and form different morphologies, maybe \"cell morphogenesis\" is relevant. Also, the model includes adhesion and contractility as factors influencing invasion. So for GeneOntology, terms would include cell proliferation (GO:0008283), apoptotic process (GO:0006915), necroptosis (GO:0070269), cell adhesion (GO:0007155), and perhaps cell morphogenesis (GO:0000902) or actin-mediated cell contraction (GO:0032154). But need to pick the most accurate terms.\n\nFor MeSH terms, the main concepts are Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (MeSH D054487), Breast Neoplasms (D001943), Cell Proliferation (D049109), Apoptosis (D017209), Necrosis (D009336), Cell Adhesion (D015815), and Contractility (if applicable). Also, terms like Neoplasm Invasiveness (D009362) and Tissue Engineering (D058109) since the text mentions engineered tissues. The geometry part might relate to \"Tissue Engineering\" or \"Models, Biological\" (D008954). Let me check MeSH terms. Ductal carcinoma in situ is D054487. Breast Neoplasms is D001943. Cell Proliferation is D049109. Apoptosis is D017209. Necrosis is D009336. Cell Adhesion is D015815. Contractility might be \"Muscle Contraction\" (D009120), but again, not sure if that's applicable here. Alternatively, \"Cell Movement\" (D002465). Tissue Engineering is D058109. Models, Biological is D008954. Also, \"Neoplasm Invasiveness\" is D009362. So for MeSH, include DCIS, Breast Neoplasms, Cell Proliferation, Apoptosis, Necrosis, Cell Adhesion, Neoplasm Invasiveness, Tissue Engineering, Models, Biological.\n\nNow, assemble all these into the JSON structure. Ensure category names are exact, IDs have no spaces, terms are correctly capitalized.\n\nChecking each term's existence:\n\nCellOntology: \"Epithelial Cell of Mammary Gland\" is CL:0002504. Correct.\n\nGeneOntology: Cell proliferation (GO:0008283), apoptotic process (GO:0006915), necroptosis (GO:0070269), cell adhesion (GO:0007155), cell morphogenesis (GO:0000902). Are these all correct? Let me confirm:\n\n- GO:0008283: \"cell population proliferation\" (synonym: cell proliferation)\n- GO:0006915: \"apoptotic process\"\n- GO:0070269: \"necroptotic process\" (the term used in the text is necrosis, but necroptosis is a programmed form of necrosis. The original text says \"necrosis\", which is more general. However, the GO term for necrosis is GO:0070265 (necrotic cell death). Wait, looking up necrosis in GO: the term is \"necrotic cell death\" (GO:0070265). So perhaps that's better. The text mentions \"necrosis\" as a process in the model. So GO:0070265 for necrotic cell death. But the user example had \"Cell Division\" as a term, so maybe the exact term should be \"necrotic cell death\". Let me check. Original text says \"necrosis\", which is the general term. So GO:0070265 is \"necrotic cell death\". So replacing the previous GO:0070269 (necroptosis) with GO:0070265. So GeneOntology entries would be:\n\n- Cell proliferation: GO:0008283\n- Apoptotic process: GO:0006915\n- Necrotic cell death: GO:0070265\n- Cell adhesion: GO:0007155\n- For contractility, perhaps \"cell morphogenesis\" (GO:0000902) is relevant as the model discusses morphologies. Alternatively, \"cell motility\" (GO:0016477). The text mentions \"invasion\" which relates to cell motility. So maybe include both cell morphogenesis and cell motility. But the model specifically mentions \"contractility\" as a factor influencing invasion. So perhaps \"cell motility\" (GO:0016477) is more relevant here.\n\nMeSH terms:\n\n- D054487: \"Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating\" (which is DCIS)\n- D001943: \"Breast Neoplasms\"\n- D049109: \"Cell Proliferation\"\n- D017209: \"Apoptosis\"\n- D009336: \"Necrosis\"\n- D015815: \"Cell Adhesion\"\n- D009362: \"Neoplasm Invasiveness\"\n- D058109: \"Tissue Engineering\"\n- D008954: \"Models, Biological\"\n\nSo, compiling all these into the JSON structure. Make sure there are no typos in IDs or terms. For example, \"Epithelial Cell of Mammary Gland\" is the exact term. Check for MeSH term \"Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating\" which is the exact term for DCIS. The user might expect \"Ductal carcinoma in situ\" as the term, but MeSH uses \"Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating\" with ID D054487. So the term should be as per MeSH.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nCellOntology has CL:0002504: Epithelial Cell of Mammary Gland.\n\nGeneOntology includes:\n\n- GO:0008283: Cell Proliferation\n- GO:0006915: Apoptotic Process\n- GO:0070265: Necrotic Cell Death\n- GO:0007155: Cell Adhesion\n- GO:0016477: Cell Motility\n\nMeSH includes:\n\n- D054487: Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating\n- D001943: Breast Neoplasms\n- D049"
