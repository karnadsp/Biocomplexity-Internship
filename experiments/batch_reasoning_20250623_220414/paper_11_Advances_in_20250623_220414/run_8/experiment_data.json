      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by breaking down the user's request. They want a JSON object with ontology annotations based on the provided paper description. The categories are CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH, each with their specific formatting requirements.\n\nFirst, I need to extract relevant terms from the original description. The paper talks about Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), so I should look for Cell Ontology terms related to epithelial and mesenchymal cells. The Cell Ontology IDs for these would be CL:0000066 for epithelial cell and CL:0008019 for mesenchymal cell.\n\nNext, for Gene Ontology terms. The paper mentions cell migration, adhesion, and invasion processes. I recall that GO has terms like \"Cell migration\" (GO:0016477), \"Cell adhesion\" (GO:0007155), and \"Biological adhesion\" (GO:0022610). Also, collagen binding might be relevant since the 3D invasion involves collagen gel adhesion, so GO:0005518 (collagen binding) could fit here.\n\nFor MeSH terms, the paper discusses cell movement (MeSH D002465), extracellular matrix (D005109), and collagen (D003093). These seem appropriate as they relate to the migration and invasion into collagen matrices described.\n\nNow, checking the formatting rules. Category names must be exact: \"CellOntology\", \"GeneOntology\", \"MeSH\". IDs need to be without spaces, like \"CL:0000066\" and \"D002465\". Term names should be exact, so \"Epithelial Cell\" and \"Mesenchymal Cell\" as per CL terms. Wait, the example in the user's message uses \"Epithelial\" without \"Cell\", but the actual Cell Ontology terms include \"cell\" in their names. For instance, the term for epithelial cell is \"epithelial cell\". Should I include the full term or shorten it? The example given by the user shows \"Epithelial\" as the term, but that might be a simplification. However, to be accurate, I should use the exact term names from the ontologies. Let me verify.\n\nLooking up Cell Ontology: The term for epithelial cells is \"epithelial cell\" (CL:0000066) and mesenchymal cell is \"mesenchymal cell\" (CL:0008019). So the terms should be \"epithelial cell\" and \"mesenchymal cell\". But the user's example uses \"Epithelial\" as the term. Hmm, this might be a conflict. The user's instructions say term names must be exact without extra spaces. So I should use the exact terms from the ontology, even if they include \"cell\". However, in their example, they have \"Epithelial\" as the term. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the example. To comply with the instructions, I should use the exact term names. So \"epithelial cell\" and \"mesenchymal cell\" would be correct. But wait, the user's example uses \"Epithelial\" (without \"cell\") as the term. This is conflicting. Let me check again. The user says: \"Term names must be exact without extra spaces\". So the exact term from the ontology is required. Therefore, I should use \"epithelial cell\" and \"mesenchymal cell\" for the CellOntology terms. But the example shows \"Epithelial\" which is different. Maybe the example is simplified. However, following the user's strict instruction, I must use the exact term names. So I will proceed with the correct terms from the ontology.\n\nSimilarly, for Gene Ontology terms: \"Cell migration\" is GO:0016477, \"Cell adhesion\" is GO:0007155, \"Biological adhesion\" is GO:0022610, and \"collagen binding\" is GO:0005518. These are the exact terms.\n\nFor MeSH, \"Cell Movement\" is D002465, \"Extracellular Matrix\" is D005109, and \"Collagen\" is D003093. Those are the exact terms.\n\nNow, structuring the JSON. Each category is an array of objects with \"id\" and \"term\". Making sure the keys are in quotes, the commas are properly placed, and the brackets are correct. Also, the IDs should not have any spaces. Checking the example given, the user uses title case for terms like \"Epithelial\" and \"Cell Division\". However, the actual ontology terms might have different capitalization. For example, MeSH terms are typically in title case, like \"Cell Movement\", \"Extracellular Matrix\", \"Collagen\". Cell Ontology terms are lowercase except proper nouns, like \"epithelial cell\". Similarly, GO terms are usually in title case, such as \"Cell migration\", \"Cell adhesion\", etc. Wait, actually, GO terms are in sentence case. Let me confirm. For example, GO:0007155 is \"cell adhesion\" in the GO database. So the term should be \"cell adhesion\" in lowercase. But the user's example shows \"Cell Division\" with title case. This is conflicting. The user's example might not be accurate. The actual term for GO:0007155 is \"cell adhesion\". Therefore, I should use the exact term as per the ontology, which is lowercase for GO terms. However, the user's example uses title case, which is inconsistent. The user's instruction says term names must be exact. So I need to use the exact case as in the ontology.\n\nChecking the GO term \"cell migration\" (GO:0016477) is indeed lowercase. Similarly, \"biological adhesion\" (GO:0022610) is lowercase. \"collagen binding\" (GO:0005518) is also lowercase. Therefore, the terms should be in lowercase as per the actual ontology entries. But the user's example shows \"Cell Division\" in title case. This discrepancy might be an error in the example. Since the user's instruction says to format the terms exactly as specified, perhaps they expect the terms to be in title case. But according to the ontologies, they are in lowercase. This is a problem. However, the user's example uses title case, so maybe they expect us to follow that despite the actual ontology's formatting. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. To resolve this, I need to check the actual terms. For example, GO:0007049 (cell cycle) is \"cell cycle\" in lowercase. Therefore, the correct terms should be in lowercase. However, the user's example uses \"Cell Division\" (title case), which might not match the actual term. But the user's instruction says term names must be exact. Therefore, I must use the exact term as in the ontology, which is lowercase for GO terms. However, the example provided by the user uses title case. This is conflicting. Since the user emphasized exact term names without extra spaces, I will use the exact terms from the ontology, even if the example is different. Therefore, for GO terms, they should be in lowercase.\n\nSimilarly, MeSH terms are in title case. For example, \"Cell Movement\" is a MeSH term (D002465), \"Extracellular Matrix\" (D005109), and \"Collagen\" (D003093) are correct as title case.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nCellOntology includes epithelial cell (CL:0000066) and mesenchymal cell (CL:0008019).\n\nGeneOntology includes cell migration (GO:0016477), cell adhesion (GO:0007155), biological adhesion (GO:0022610), and collagen binding (GO:0005518).\n\nMeSH includes Cell Movement (D002465), Extracellular Matrix (D005109), and Collagen (D003093).\n\nWait, but the original paper mentions \"endocardial adhesion\" and \"endocardial cohesion\". However, endocardial is specific, but maybe those are part of cell adhesion in general. The model focuses on adhesion processes, so including cell adhesion and biological adhesion makes sense. Collagen binding is relevant for the 3D invasion into collagen gel.\n\nAlso, the 2D migration and 3D invasion conditions relate to cell movement and extracellular matrix interaction, hence the MeSH terms.\n\nI think that's all. Now, formatting the JSON correctly, ensuring no trailing commas, proper quotes, and exact IDs and terms.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000066\",\n            \"term\": \"epithelial cell\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0008019\",\n            \"term\": \"mesenchymal cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0016477\",\n            \"term\": \"cell migration\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007155\",\n            \"term\": \"cell adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0022610\",\n            \"term\": \"biological adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0005518\",\n            \"term\": \"collagen binding\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002465\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Movement\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D005109\",\n            \"term\": \"Extracellular Matrix\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D003093\",\n            \"term\": \"Collagen\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"

Basic cell types and parameters based on the ontology annotations",
      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CompuCell3D simulation file based on the given ontology annotations. First, I need to recall the structure of a typical CompuCell3D Python script. The user specified that the code must include required imports, a simulation class inheriting from SteppableBasePy, and the necessary methods: __init__, start, and step. Also, basic cell types and parameters based on the provided ontology.\n\nLooking at the ontology annotations, there are two cell types: epithelial and mesenchymal cells. The GeneOntology terms include cell migration, biological adhesion, collagen binding, and cell adhesion. MeSH terms mention Collagen, Cell Movement, and Extracellular Matrix. So, the simulation should involve these cell types interacting with collagen and the extracellular matrix, possibly involving adhesion and migration.\n\nStarting with the imports. CompuCellSetup is needed to set up the simulation. From steppables, we'll need SteppableBasePy. Also, the cc3d module for core functionalities like cell types, plugins, and parameters.\n\nNext, the simulation class. It should inherit from SteppableBasePy. The __init__ method will call the parent's __init__. The start method is where we initialize cells, maybe set up the extracellular matrix. The step method can handle behaviors each time step, like chemotaxis for migration.\n\nFor cell types, we'll define epithelial and mesenchymal cells. The parameters should include adhesion properties since cell adhesion is a key term. The extracellular matrix (ECM) might be represented with collagen. Using the VolumePlugin to enforce cell volume constraints, and the ContactPlugin for adhesion energies between cell types and the medium.\n\nIn the start method, I'll create a cell field and maybe initialize some cells. The ECM setup could involve using the FlexibleDiffusionSolverFE for collagen diffusion, but perhaps a simpler approach is to use the Secretion plugin to represent collagen in the ECM. Alternatively, using the ECM plugin might be more appropriate. Wait, ECM in CompuCell3D can be handled with the ExtraFieldPlugin or by using a chemical field. Since collagen is mentioned, maybe a diffusion field for collagen that cells interact with.\n\nMesenchymal cells might have chemotaxis towards collagen, promoting migration. So, in the step method, I can check if it's a mesenchymal cell and apply a chemotaxis parameter towards the collagen field. Also, adhesion parameters need to be set between the cell types and the medium, as well as between the cells themselves.\n\nSo, putting it all together: define the cell types, set up adhesion energies, initialize cells, set up a collagen field, and implement chemotaxis for mesenchymal cells. Also, ensure that the simulation includes volume and contact constraints.\n\nWait, the user mentioned 'collagen binding' which might imply that cells interact with collagen via adhesion or secretion. Maybe using ContactInternal for cell-ECM adhesion. But in CompuCell, contact energy is between cell types and medium or between cells. So perhaps the ECM is represented as a medium with collagen, and set the adhesion energy between cells and medium accordingly. Alternatively, use a separate field for collagen and have cells respond via chemotaxis.\n\nHmm, perhaps the simplest way is to use the standard contact energy between cell types and medium, and also set up a diffusion field for collagen. Then, in the steppable, apply chemotaxis to mesenchymal cells towards higher collagen concentrations.\n\nSo, in the XML part (which is part of the CompuCell3D setup), we need to include plugins for Volume, Contact, Chemotaxis, and maybe Secretion. But since the user wants Python code, the simulation setup in Python would include these plugins via the register_steppable and calls to self.cellField. Also, using the CompuCellSetup.register_steppable to add the steppable class.\n\nWait, in CompuCell3D's Python setup, the main script often sets up the simulation by creating a CompuCell3DSimulation instance, then adding steppables. But the user is asking for the Python code that would be a simulation file, which typically includes the necessary imports and a steppable class. So, perhaps the code will register the plugins within the start method.\n\nAlternatively, the plugins can be configured via the XML file, but since the user wants all in Python, maybe the code includes the plugin configurations via the SimulatorCore.\n\nWait, no. In CompuCell3D, the main simulation parameters (like plugins) are usually set in an XML file, but when using pure Python, you can configure them via the simulator core. However, the user's request is to generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file, which is a Python script. So, perhaps the code will import the necessary modules and set up the simulation within the Python script.\n\nLet me structure the code step by step:\n\n1. Imports: CompuCellSetup, steppables, cc3d, and perhaps other modules like sys.\n\n2. The simulation class inheriting from SteppableBasePy. In the __init__, call the parent's __init__.\n\n3. In the start method, initialize cell types, set up the extracellular matrix (maybe a collagen field), and configure plugins like Volume, Contact, Chemotaxis.\n\n4. The step method could handle cell behaviors each time step, like applying chemotaxis to mesenchymal cells.\n\nWait, but how to set up the plugins in Python? For example, the VolumePlugin parameters (target volume and lambda) are set in the XML. In Python, perhaps we can access the simulator core and set these parameters via the steppable's start method.\n\nYes. So in the start method, after getting the simulator core, we can configure the plugins. For example:\n\nvol_plugin = CompuCell.getVolumeTrackerPlugin()\nvol_plugin.setParams(250, 2.0)\n\nBut I need to check the correct syntax. Alternatively, using the SimulatorCoreInterface to set parameters.\n\nAlternatively, the code may use the cc3d modules to configure the plugins. For example:\n\nfrom cc3d.core.PyCoreSpecs import VolumePluginSpec, ContactPluginSpec, ChemotaxisPluginSpec\n\nThen, in the start method, add these specs to the simulator.\n\nBut perhaps the user expects a more traditional approach where plugins are configured via the XML, but since the user wants all code in Python, we need to configure them via the simulator core.\n\nAlternatively, using the XML generator within Python. However, the user might expect the code to use the standard approach where the Python script includes the necessary plugin configurations via the simulator core.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is using the core CompuCell3D Python API to set up the simulation parameters.\n\nThis part is a bit tricky. Let's think. The standard CompuCell3D simulation script in Python would have:\n\nimport sys\nfrom cc3d import CompuCellSetup\nfrom cc3d.core.XMLUtils import ElementCC3D\n\nThen, generate the XML elements. But the user wants the code to be self-contained in Python without XML. Alternatively, use the new Python API where you can set up the simulation using Python specifications.\n\nBut perhaps the user expects a traditional script using the XML. Wait, but the user said \"Generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file. Return ONLY the Python code...\".\n\nSo, perhaps the code uses the newer cc3d Python API, where you can define the simulation using Python classes and specs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is written in the old style, using the XML for configuration but embedded in Python. However, the user wants the Python code to include everything.\n\nHmm. Let me proceed with the code that uses the necessary imports and defines the steppable with the required methods, sets up the cell types, and configures plugins via the simulator core in the start method.\n\nSo, in the start method:\n\n- Set up cell types (epithelial, mesenchymal)\n- Configure VolumePlugin parameters (target volume, lambda)\n- Configure ContactPlugin adhesion energies between cell types and medium\n- Set up a chemical field for collagen (ECM)\n- Configure ChemotaxisPlugin for mesenchymal cells towards collagen\n\nBut how to do this in Python?\n\nFor example, to create a chemical field, we can use the add_chemical_field method. Then, use the chemotaxis plugin to set the chemical for a cell type.\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible structure:\n\nIn the start method:\n\nself.cell_type_epithelial = self.new_cell_type(\"Epithelial\")\nself.cell_type_mesenchymal = self.new_cell_type(\"Mesenchymal\")\n\nThen, configure the volume plugin:\n\nvolume_plugin = self.get_xml_element('VolumePlugin')\nvolume_plugin[cell_type_epithelial] = {'TargetVolume':25, 'LambdaVolume':2.0}\nBut I need to check the correct way.\n\nAlternatively, using the CompuCellSetup's simulator:\n\nsimulator = CompuCellSetup.getSimulator()\nsimulator.register_steppable(MySteppable())\n\nBut perhaps in the start method, the code can access the simulator core to configure plugins.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nIn the start method of the steppable, use the cellField to create cells. Then, set parameters via the plugin APIs.\n\nFor example, to set the target volume and lambda for each cell type, perhaps using:\n\nfor cell in self.cell_list:\n    if cell.type == self.cell_type_epithelial:\n        cell.targetVolume = 25\n        cell.lambdaVolume = 2.0\n    elif cell.type == self.cell_type_mesenchymal:\n        cell.targetVolume = 25\n        cell.lambdaVolume"

The user's instruction says term names must be exact. So I need to use the exact case as in the ontology.\n\nChecking the GO term \"cell migration\" (GO:0016477) is indeed lowercase. Similarly, \"biological adhesion\" (GO:0022610) is lowercase. \"collagen binding\" (GO:0005518) is also lowercase. Therefore, the terms should be in lowercase as per the actual ontology entries. But the user's example shows \"Cell Division\" in title case. This discrepancy might be an error in the example. Since the user's instruction says to format the terms exactly as specified, perhaps they expect the terms to be in title case. But according to the ontologies, they are in lowercase. This is a problem. However, the user's example uses title case, so maybe they expect us to follow that despite the actual ontology's formatting. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. To resolve this, I need to check the actual terms. For example, GO:0007049 (cell cycle) is \"cell cycle\" in lowercase. Therefore, the correct terms should be in lowercase. However, the user's example uses \"Cell Division\" (title case), which might not match the actual term. But the user's instruction says term names must be exact. Therefore, I must use the exact term as in the ontology, which is lowercase for GO terms. However, the example provided by the user uses title case. This is conflicting. Since the user emphasized exact term names without extra spaces, I will use the exact terms from the ontology, even if the example is different. Therefore, for GO terms, they should be in lowercase.\n\nSimilarly, MeSH terms are in title case. For example, \"Cell Movement\" is a MeSH term (D002465), \"Extracellular Matrix\" (D005109), and \"Collagen\" (D003093) are correct as title case.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nCellOntology includes epithelial cell (CL:0000066) and mesenchymal cell (CL:0008019).\n\nGeneOntology includes cell migration (GO:0016477), cell adhesion (GO:0007155), biological adhesion (GO:0022610), and collagen binding (GO:0005518).\n\nMeSH includes Cell Movement (D002465), Extracellular Matrix (D005109), and Collagen (D003093).\n\nWait, but the original paper mentions \"endocardial adhesion\" and \"endocardial cohesion\". However, endocardial is specific, but maybe those are part of cell adhesion in general. The model focuses on adhesion processes, so including cell adhesion and biological adhesion makes sense. Collagen binding is relevant for the 3D invasion into collagen gel.\n\nAlso, the 2D migration and 3D invasion conditions relate to cell movement and extracellular matrix interaction, hence the MeSH terms.\n\nI think that's all. Now, formatting the JSON correctly, ensuring no trailing commas, proper quotes, and exact IDs and terms.\n</think>",

      "python_code": "from cc3d.core.PySteppables import *\n\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CompuCell3D simulation file based on the given ontology annotations. First, I need to recall the structure of a typical CompuCell3D Python script. The user specified that the code must include required imports, a simulation class inheriting from SteppableBasePy, and the necessary methods: __init__, start, and step. Also, basic cell types and parameters based on the provided ontology.\n\nLooking at the ontology annotations, there are two cell types: epithelial and mesenchymal cells. The GeneOntology terms include cell migration, biological adhesion, collagen binding, and cell adhesion. MeSH terms mention Collagen, Cell Movement, and Extracellular Matrix. So, the simulation should involve these cell types interacting with collagen and the extracellular matrix, possibly involving adhesion and migration.\n\nStarting with the imports. CompuCellSetup is needed to set up the simulation. From steppables, we'll need SteppableBasePy. Also, the cc3d module for core functionalities like cell types, plugins, and parameters.\n\nNext, the simulation class. It should inherit from SteppableBasePy. The __init__ method will call the parent's __init__. The start method is where we initialize cells, maybe set up the extracellular matrix. The step method can handle behaviors each time step, like chemotaxis for migration.\n\nFor cell types, we'll define epithelial and mesenchymal cells. The parameters should include adhesion properties since cell adhesion is a key term. The extracellular matrix (ECM) might be represented with collagen. Using the VolumePlugin to enforce cell volume constraints, and the ContactPlugin for adhesion energies between cell types and the medium.\n\nIn the start method, I'll create a cell field and maybe initialize some cells. The ECM setup could involve using the FlexibleDiffusionSolverFE for collagen diffusion, but perhaps a simpler approach is to use the Secretion plugin to represent collagen in the ECM. Alternatively, using the ECM plugin might be more appropriate. Wait, ECM in CompuCell3D can be handled with the ExtraFieldPlugin or by using a chemical field. Since collagen is mentioned, maybe a diffusion field for collagen that cells interact with.\n\nMesenchymal cells might have chemotaxis towards collagen, promoting migration. So, in the step method, I can check if it's a mesenchymal cell and apply a chemotaxis parameter towards the collagen field. Also, adhesion parameters need to be set between the cell types and the medium, as well as between the cells themselves.\n\nSo, putting it all together: define the cell types, set up adhesion energies, initialize cells, set up a collagen field, and implement chemotaxis for mesenchymal cells. Also, ensure that the simulation includes volume and contact constraints.\n\nWait, the user mentioned 'collagen binding' which might imply that cells interact with collagen via adhesion or secretion. Maybe using ContactInternal for cell-ECM adhesion. But in CompuCell, contact energy is between cell types and medium or between cells. So perhaps the ECM is represented as a medium with collagen, and set the adhesion energy between cells and medium accordingly. Alternatively, use a separate field for collagen and have cells respond via chemotaxis.\n\nHmm, perhaps the simplest way is to use the standard contact energy between cell types and medium, and also set up a diffusion field for collagen. Then, in the steppable, apply chemotaxis to mesenchymal cells towards higher collagen concentrations.\n\nSo, in the XML part (which is part of the CompuCell3D setup), we need to include plugins for Volume, Contact, Chemotaxis, and maybe Secretion. But since the user wants Python code, the simulation setup in Python would include these plugins via the register_steppable and calls to self.cellField. Also, using the CompuCellSetup.register_steppable to add the steppable class.\n\nWait, in CompuCell3D's Python setup, the main script often sets up the simulation by creating a CompuCell3DSimulation instance, then adding steppables. But the user is asking for the Python code that would be a simulation file, which typically includes the necessary imports and a steppable class. So, perhaps the code will register the plugins within the start method.\n\nAlternatively, the plugins can be configured via the XML file, but since the user wants all in Python, maybe the code includes the plugin configurations via the SimulatorCore.\n\nWait, no. In CompuCell3D, the main simulation parameters (like plugins) are usually set in an XML file, but when using pure Python, you can configure them via the simulator core. However, the user's request is to generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file, which is a Python script. So, perhaps the code will import the necessary modules and set up the simulation within the Python script.\n\nLet me structure the code step by step:\n\n1. Imports: CompuCellSetup, steppables, cc3d, and perhaps other modules like sys.\n\n2. The simulation class inheriting from SteppableBasePy. In the __init__, call the parent's __init__.\n\n3. In the start method, initialize cell types, set up the extracellular matrix (maybe a collagen field), and configure plugins like Volume, Contact, Chemotaxis.\n\n4. The step method could handle cell behaviors each time step, like applying chemotaxis to mesenchymal cells.\n\nWait, but how to set up the plugins in Python? For example, the VolumePlugin parameters (target volume and lambda) are set in the XML. In Python, perhaps we can access the simulator core and set these parameters via the steppable's start method.\n\nYes. So in the start method, after getting the simulator core, we can configure the plugins. For example:\n\nvol_plugin = CompuCell.getVolumeTrackerPlugin()\nvol_plugin.setParams(250, 2.0)\n\nBut I need to check the correct syntax. Alternatively, using the SimulatorCoreInterface to set parameters.\n\nAlternatively, the code may use the cc3d modules to configure the plugins. For example:\n\nfrom cc3d.core.PyCoreSpecs import VolumePluginSpec, ContactPluginSpec, ChemotaxisPluginSpec\n\nThen, in the start method, add these specs to the simulator.\n\nBut perhaps the user expects a more traditional approach where plugins are configured via the XML, but since the user wants all code in Python, we need to configure them via the simulator core.\n\nAlternatively, using the XML generator within Python. However, the user might expect the code to use the standard approach where the Python script includes the necessary plugin configurations via the simulator core.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is using the core CompuCell3D Python API to set up the simulation parameters.\n\nThis part is a bit tricky. Let's think. The standard CompuCell3D simulation script in Python would have:\n\nimport sys\nfrom cc3d import CompuCellSetup\nfrom cc3d.core.XMLUtils import ElementCC3D\n\nThen, generate the XML elements. But the user wants the code to be self-contained in Python without XML. Alternatively, use the new Python API where you can set up the simulation using Python specifications.\n\nBut perhaps the user expects a traditional script using the XML. Wait, but the user said \"Generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file. Return ONLY the Python code...\".\n\nSo, perhaps the code uses the newer cc3d Python API, where you can define the simulation using Python classes and specs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is written in the old style, using the XML for configuration but embedded in Python. However, the user wants the Python code to include everything.\n\nHmm. Let me proceed with the code that uses the necessary imports and defines the steppable with the required methods, sets up the cell types, and configures plugins via the simulator core in the start method.\n\nSo, in the start method:\n\n- Set up cell types (epithelial, mesenchymal)\n- Configure VolumePlugin parameters (target volume, lambda)\n- Configure ContactPlugin adhesion energies between cell types and medium\n- Set up a chemical field for collagen (ECM)\n- Configure ChemotaxisPlugin for mesenchymal cells towards collagen\n\nBut how to do this in Python?\n\nFor example, to create a chemical field, we can use the add_chemical_field method. Then, use the chemotaxis plugin to set the chemical for a cell type.\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible structure:\n\nIn the start method:\n\nself.cell_type_epithelial = self.new_cell_type(\"Epithelial\")\nself.cell_type_mesenchymal = self.new_cell_type(\"Mesenchymal\")\n\nThen, configure the volume plugin:\n\nvolume_plugin = self.get_xml_element('VolumePlugin')\nvolume_plugin[cell_type_epithelial] = {'TargetVolume':25, 'LambdaVolume':2.0}\nBut I need to check the correct way.\n\nAlternatively, using the CompuCellSetup's simulator:\n\nsimulator = CompuCellSetup.getSimulator()\nsimulator.register_steppable(MySteppable())\n\nBut perhaps in the start method, the code can access the simulator core to configure plugins.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nIn the start method of the steppable, use the cellField to create cells. Then, set parameters via the plugin APIs.\n\nFor example, to set the target volume and lambda for each cell type, perhaps using:\n\nfor cell in self.cell_list:\n    if cell.type == self.cell_type_epithelial:\n        cell.targetVolume = 25\n        cell.lambdaVolume = 2.0\n    elif cell.type == self.cell_type_mesenchymal:\n        cell.targetVolume = 25\n        cell.lambdaVolume",
