        "description": "A key step in blood vessel development (angiogenesis) is lumen formation: the hollowing of vessels for blood perfusion. Two alternative lumen formation mechanisms are suggested to function in different types of blood vessels. The vacuolation mechanism is suggested for lumen formation in small vessels by coalescence of intracellular vacuoles, a view that was extended to extracellular lumen formation by exocytosis of vacuoles. The cell\u2013cell repulsion mechanism is suggested to initiate extracellular lumen formation in large vessels by active repulsion of adjacent cells, and active cell shape changes extend the lumen. We used an agent-based computer model, based on the cellular Potts model, to compare and study both mechanisms separately and combined. An extensive sensitivity analysis shows that each of the mechanisms on its own can produce lumens in a narrow region of parameter space. However, combining both mechanisms makes lumen formation much more robust to the values of the parameters, suggesting that the mechanisms may work synergistically and operate in parallel, rather than in different vessel types."

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a JSON object with ontology annotations based on the provided information about blood vessel development, specifically lumen formation. Let's start by parsing the original description.\n\nThe main topics here are angiogenesis, lumen formation mechanisms (vacuolation and cell-cell repulsion), and the cellular Potts model. For CellOntology, terms related to blood vessel cells. Maybe endothelial cells? Check Cell Ontology for terms. CL:0000115 is endothelial cell.\n\nGeneOntology: Processes like angiogenesis (GO:0001525), lumen formation (GO:0045216), exocytosis (GO:0006887), cell shape changes (GO:0008360). Also cell-cell adhesion (GO:0098742) might be relevant for repulsion.\n\nMeSH terms: Angiogenesis (D000096), Blood Vessels (D001808), Exocytosis (D005094), maybe Models, Biological (D008957) for the cellular Potts model. Cell Shape could be D002468. Wait, checking MeSH for cell shape: \"Cell Shape\" is D002468. Yes. Also, maybe \"Computer Simulation\" as D003196.\n\nWait, the model used is agent-based and cellular Potts. MeSH terms for models: \"Models, Biological\" (D008957) and \"Computer Simulation\" (D003196). Should include both.\n\nCheck if vacuolation is a MeSH term. Searching MeSH, \"Vacuoles\" is D014617. But the process here is vacuolation, maybe use \"Vacuoles\" as the term. Similarly, exocytosis is already in GO.\n\nFor CellOntology, the cells involved in angiogenesis are endothelial cells, so CL:0000115. Are there other cell types mentioned? The text mentions small and large vessels, but no specific cell types beyond endothelial cells. So stick with endothelial cell.\n\nGeneOntology terms: The two mechanisms involve vacuole coalescence (exocytosis) and cell-cell repulsion (which might relate to cell adhesion or cell-cell junction). So \"exocytosis\" (GO:0006887), \"cell-cell adhesion\" (GO:0098742), \"lumen formation\" (GO:0045216), \"angiogenesis\" (GO:0001525), \"cell shape changes\" (GO:0008360). Are there others? The model uses cell proliferation? The original description mentions cell proliferation isn't the focus, but lumen formation. So maybe not. The sensitivity analysis is about parameters, but the main GO terms are the processes involved in the mechanisms.\n\nMeSH: \"Angiogenesis\" (D000096), \"Blood Vessels\" (D001808), \"Exocytosis\" (D005094), \"Vacuoles\" (D014617), \"Cell Shape\" (D002468), \"Models, Biological\" (D008957), \"Computer Simulation\" (D003196). \n\nNeed to ensure all terms are correctly capitalized and IDs are formatted without spaces. Let me verify each term and ID:\n\nCellOntology:\n- Endothelial cell: CL:0000115. Term is \"Endothelial Cell\".\n\nGeneOntology:\n- Angiogenesis: GO:0001525, term \"Angiogenesis\".\n- Lumen formation: GO:0045216, term \"lumen formation\" (note lowercase in GO, but the example had \"Cell Division\" capitalized. Wait, check GO term for \"lumen formation\". The official term is \"lumen formation\" (GO:0045216), which is lowercase. But in the example, terms are capitalized. Hmm, the user specified term names must be exact. So if the GO term is \"lumen formation\", we should write it as is. Wait, checking GO:0045216, the term is \"lumen formation\", so lowercase. But in the example given, \"Cell Division\" is capitalized. This is a conflict. Wait, the user's example shows \"Cell Division\" which is the actual term (GO:0007059). Wait, GO:0007059 is \"cell cycle\", but \"cell division\" is GO:0051301. Wait, maybe the example was simplified. The user's instruction says term names must be exact. So need to use the exact term as per the ontology. So for GO:0045216, the term is \"lumen formation\". Similarly, \"exocytosis\" is GO:0006887. Check exact term names.\n\nGO:0001525 is \"angiogenesis\", but the term is actually \"angiogenesis\" (lowercase), but sometimes in GO they are capitalized. Wait, no, GO terms are usually in lowercase. Let me check:\n\nGO:0001525: \"angiogenesis\" (correct term is \"angiogenesis\", all lowercase). Similarly, GO:0045216 is \"lumen formation\". So the terms should be written as they are in the ontology. But the example given by the user uses \"Cell Division\" which is capitalized. Hmm, maybe the user's example is simplified. But according to the instructions, term names must be exact. Therefore, I should use the exact term as in the ontology, even if it's lowercase. But the example shows \"Cell Division\" which is the actual term (GO:0007059 is \"cell division\", lowercase). Wait, no: GO:0051301 is \"cell division\", but maybe the example was incorrect. This is a problem. The user's example uses \"Cell Division\" with capital letters, but in reality, GO terms are in lowercase. So perhaps the user expects the terms to be capitalized as per standard naming conventions, not exactly as in the ontology. But the instruction says: \"Term names must be exact without extra spaces\". So perhaps the exact term as per the ontology, even if lowercase. For example, \"angiogenesis\" (GO:0001525) is lowercase. But the user's example has \"Cell Division\" which is in title case. This is conflicting. However, given the instruction to be exact, I need to check the actual terms.\n\nChecking GO:0001525: name is \"angiogenesis\". So term should be \"angiogenesis\". Similarly, GO:0045216 is \"lumen formation\". Exocytosis is GO:0006887, term is \"exocytosis\". Cell-cell adhesion is GO:0098742, term is \"cell-cell adhesion\". Cell shape changes: GO:0008360, term is \"regulation of cell shape\". Wait, the process here is cell shape changes, but the GO term might be \"regulation of cell shape\". Alternatively, \"cell morphogenesis\" (GO:0000902). The description mentions \"active cell shape changes\", so maybe \"cell morphogenesis\" (GO:0000902). Alternatively, \"cell morphogenesis involved in differentiation\" (GO:0000904). Hmm. Alternatively, \"cell morphogenesis\" (GO:0000902) is more general. Let me check: GO:0008360 is \"regulation of cell shape\", which is the process of controlling cell shape. The description says \"active cell shape changes extend the lumen\", so maybe \"regulation of cell shape\" (GO:0008360). \n\nSo GeneOntology entries would be:\n- \"angiogenesis\" (GO:0001525)\n- \"lumen formation\" (GO:0045216)\n- \"exocytosis\" (GO:0006887)\n- \"cell-cell adhesion\" (GO:0098742)\n- \"regulation of cell shape\" (GO:0008360)\n\nMeSH terms:\n- \"Angiogenesis\" (D000096) (MeSH term is \"Neovascularization, Physiologic\" but entry term is \"Angiogenesis\")\nWait, checking MeSH for D000096: The exact term is \"Neovascularization, Physiologic\", but the entry terms include \"Angiogenesis\". However, the user wants the term name exact. So if the MeSH term's heading is \"Neovascularization, Physiologic\", then that's the term to use. But the user might expect \"Angiogenesis\". This is tricky. Let me verify. The MeSH UI for angiogenesis is D000096, and the heading is \"Neovascularization, Physiologic\". The entry terms include \"Angiogenesis\". But the user instruction says term names must be exact. So the correct term is \"Neovascularization, Physiologic\". But the original text uses \"angiogenesis\". However, the user might prefer the exact MeSH term. Alternatively, perhaps the entry term \"Angiogenesis\" is acceptable. But MeSH's preferred term is \"Neovascularization, Physiologic\". This is a problem. How to resolve?\n\nSimilarly, for MeSH, \"Blood Vessels\" is D001808, term \"Blood Vessels\". \"Exocytosis\" is D005094. \"Vacuoles\" is D014617. \"Cell Shape\" is D002468. \"Models, Biological\" is D008957. \"Computer Simulation\" is D003196.\n\nSo the MeSH terms would be:\n- D000096: \"Neovascularization, Physiologic\"\n- D001808: \"Blood Vessels\"\n- D005094: \"Exocytosis\"\n- D014617: \"Vacuoles\"\n- D002468: \"Cell Shape\"\n- D008957: \"Models, Biological\"\n- D003196: \"Computer Simulation\"\n\nBut the original text uses \"angiogenesis\", so maybe the user expects the term \"Angiogenesis\" even if the MeSH term is different. However, according to the instructions, term names must be exact. Therefore, we have to use the exact MeSH"
