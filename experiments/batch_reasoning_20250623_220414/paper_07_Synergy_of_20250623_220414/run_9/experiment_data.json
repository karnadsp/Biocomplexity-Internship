Two alternative lumen formation mechanisms are suggested to function in different types of blood vessels. The vacuolation mechanism is suggested for lumen formation in small vessels by coalescence of intracellular vacuoles, a view that was extended to extracellular lumen formation by exocytosis of vacuoles. The cell\u2013cell repulsion mechanism is suggested to initiate extracellular lumen formation in large vessels by active repulsion of adjacent cells, and active cell shape changes extend the lumen. We used an agent-based computer model, based on the cellular Potts model, to compare and study both mechanisms separately and combined. An extensive sensitivity analysis shows that each of the mechanisms on its own can produce lumens in a narrow region of parameter space. However, combining both mechanisms makes lumen formation much more robust to the values of the parameters, suggesting that the mechanisms may work synergistically and operate in parallel, rather than in different vessel types."

Basic cell types and parameters based on the ontology annotations",
      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out how to generate the CompuCell3D simulation file based on the user's query and the provided ontology annotations. The user wants a valid Python script that includes specific elements: required imports, a simulation class inheriting from SteppableBasePy, __init__, start, and step methods, and basic cell types and parameters based on the ontology given.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the structure of a typical CompuCell3D simulation script. The main components are the imports, the simulation class, and the setup. The simulation class should inherit from SteppableBasePy and implement the necessary methods. The ontology annotations provided include Endothelial cells, processes like angiogenesis, exocytosis, cell junction organization, and cell morphogenesis, as well as MeSH terms related to biological models and sensitivity analysis.\n\nStarting with the imports. The standard imports are from CompuCellSetup and steppables. Also, since there's a mention of cell types, I'll need to import the cell module. Maybe also the Potts module for setting up the simulation parameters.\n\nNext, the simulation class. The user specified that it must inherit from SteppableBasePy. So the class definition would be something like class SimulationSteppable(steppables.SteppableBasePy). The __init__ method should call the parent's __init__, and perhaps initialize any parameters. The start method is where initial setup happens, like setting up cell types and fields. The step method is called every simulation step.\n\nLooking at the ontology annotations: the cell type is EndothelialCell. So in the start method, I need to define this cell type. The Gene Ontology terms suggest processes like cell-cell junction organization (which might relate to adhesion), exocytosis (maybe secretion of factors), angiogenesis (formation of blood vessels), and cell morphogenesis (shape changes). The MeSH terms include angiogenesis, biological models, sensitivity analysis, and blood vessels. \n\nFor the simulation parameters, the Potts section would need dimensions, steps, temperature (fluctuation amplitude), and neighbor order. Then, setting up the volume plugin to manage cell volume constraints. Since there's cell morphogenesis, maybe including a connectivity global plugin to maintain cell connectivity. Adhesion is related to cell-cell junctions, so including a contact plugin with adhesion energies between cell types. For exocytosis or secretion, perhaps a secretion plugin to simulate growth factors that promote angiogenesis.\n\nIn the start method, I should initialize cells. Maybe create a cluster of Endothelial cells to form a blood vessel. Using the buildWheel method to create a circular structure. Also, assigning different types to distinguish between vessel cells and surrounding cells if needed, but the ontology only mentions Endothelial cells. Wait, the user specified \"basic cell types\" based on the ontology, which includes EndothelialCell. So maybe the main cell type is Endothelial, and the rest could be medium or another type.\n\nFor the step method, processes related to angiogenesis could involve cells migrating or proliferating in response to some signal. Sensitivity analysis might relate to varying parameters, but since the user wants a basic setup, perhaps just including a check in the step method for some condition. Cell morphogenesis could involve adjusting target volume or adhesion parameters over time.\n\nPutting it all together, the code should import necessary modules, set up the simulation with Potts parameters, define cell types (Endothelial and maybe Medium), set up volume, contact, connectivity, and secretion plugins. In the start method, create a central cluster of Endothelial cells. In the step method, maybe adjust secretion or apply a chemical field gradient to simulate angiogenesis.\n\nWait, the user's ontology includes exocytosis (GO:0006887), which might be modeled via secretion. So including a secretion plugin where Endothelial cells secrete a chemical (e.g., VEGF) that promotes angiogenesis. Also, cell morphogenesis could involve changing cell target volume or adhesion over time.\n\nBut the user asked for a basic setup. So perhaps the simulation initializes a grid with some Endothelial cells, sets up adhesion parameters, and in each step, maybe the cells grow or secrete a substance. The exact biological processes might be simplified.\n\nI need to ensure that all the required components are included: imports, simulation class with __init__, start, step. Also, cell types based on the ontology. The code should run without errors in CompuCell3D.\n\nChecking the code structure:\n\n- Imports: from PyCondor.CompuCell import CompuCellSetup, plus others like steppables, cell, etc.\nWait, actually, the correct imports are usually:\n\nfrom pyecs.CompuCell import CompuCellSetup\nfrom pyecs.CompuCell import steppables\nimport CompuCell\n\nBut maybe the standard is:\n\nimport sys\nfrom os import environ\nfrom pathlib import Path\nsys.path.append(str(Path(environ[\"CC3D_PYTHON_HOME\"]) / \"lib\"))\nimport CompuCellSetup\nfrom CompuCell import *\nimport PySteppables\n\nBut perhaps the user expects a simplified version. Alternatively, the standard imports for a CompuCell3D script are:\n\nfrom PySteppables import *\nimport CompuCell\nimport sys\n\nBut I might need to adjust based on the latest CompuCell3D practices. However, the user might expect the standard template. Let me recall the typical structure.\n\nThe main setup usually involves:\n\nimport CompuCellSetup\nfrom PySteppables import *\n\nThen, defining a steppable class that inherits from SteppableBasePy. The start method initializes cells, the step method handles each step.\n\nSo the code would start with:\n\nimport CompuCellSetup\nfrom PySteppables import *\nfrom random import randint\n\nThen, the class:\n\nclass SimulationSteppable(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, simulator, _frequency=1):\n        SteppableBasePy.__init__(self, simulator, _frequency)\n\n    def start(self):\n        # Setup here\n\n    def step(self, mcs):\n        # Step logic here\n\nThen, the CompuCellSetup.register_steppable(steppable=SimulationSteppable(frequency=1)).\n\nBut perhaps the user wants the code to include all necessary plugins and parameters. The ontology mentions angiogenesis, so maybe a chemotaxis plugin towards a growth factor. Also, cell-cell adhesion for junction organization.\n\nPutting all together, the code would set up the simulation with the necessary plugins (volume, contact, chemotaxis, secretion), define the Endothelial cell type with appropriate parameters, create initial cells, and in each step maybe adjust secretion or apply chemotaxis.\n\nBut to keep it basic, perhaps the code includes the setup for adhesion, volume constraints, and a simple cell arrangement. The step method could be empty except for pass, but the user might expect some basic logic.\n\nSo the final code would include:\n\n- CompuCellSetup initialization with the XML elements (potts, volume, contact, etc.)\n- The steppable class with start method creating cells, and step method perhaps adjusting parameters.\n\nWait, the user specified that the code must include required imports, a proper simulation class that inherits from steppables.SteppableBasePy, and the methods __init__, start, step.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nimport CompuCellSetup\nfrom PySteppables import *\nfrom PySteppables import (\n    SteppableBasePy,\n    Dim3D,\n    CellInventory,\n    CellG,\n    MitosisSteppableBase,\n)\n\nclass SimulationSteppable(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, simulator, _frequency=1):\n        super().__init__(simulator, _frequency)\n        # Initialize any parameters\n\n    def start(self):\n        # Set up cell types\n        self.endothelial_type = self.cell_type_dict[\"Endothelial\"]\n        # Create cells here, maybe a cluster\n\n    def step(self, mcs):\n        # Implement step logic, like secretion, chemotaxis, etc.\n\nBut also, the XML setup is part of CompuCell3D. However, the user wants a Python script, so the code would use the CompuCellSetup functions to configure the simulation.\n\nWait, in CompuCell3D, the Python script typically configures the simulation via the XMLWriter. So the code would include:\n\nCompuCellSetup.register_steppable(steppable=SimulationSteppable(frequency=1))\n\nBut the main part is the XML configuration. Alternatively, the user might want the Python script to generate the XML configuration through code.\n\nBut perhaps the answer should use the XMLWriter to set up the simulation parameters. For example:\n\nfrom CompuCellSetup import *\n\nsim, simthread = CompuCellSetup.getCoreSimulationObjects()\n\n# Configure Potts\npotts = sim.getPotts()\npotts.setDimX(100)\npotts.setDimY(100)\npotts.setDimZ(1)\npotts.setSteps(1000)\npotts.setTemperature(10)\npotts.setNeighborOrder(2)\n\n# Add plugins\nvolume_plugin = CompuCell.VolumeTracker()\nsim.addSteppable(volume_plugin)\n\ncontact_plugin = CompuCell.ContactLocalFlex(\n    {\"Medium\": {\"Endothelial\": 2, \"Medium\": 1}, \"Endothelial\": {\"Endothelial\": 1}}\n)\nsim.addSteppable(contact_plugin)\n\nBut integrating this into the Python script. However, the user's request is for a Python script that includes the necessary elements. The standard approach is to use the XMLWriter, but in some cases"
