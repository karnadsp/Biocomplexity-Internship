      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by breaking down the problem. The user wants structured ontology annotations based on the provided description of blood vessel development and lumen formation. The key here is to extract relevant terms from Cell Ontology (CL), Gene Ontology (GO), and MeSH.\n\nFirst, the original text talks about angiogenesis, which is blood vessel development. So I need to find the correct GO term for angiogenesis. I recall that angiogenesis has a specific GO ID. Let me check that. Yes, \"angiogenesis\" is GO:0001525.\n\nNext, lumen formation is mentioned. Lumen development is part of morphogenesis, so the GO term for lumen formation in vasculature. That would be GO:0001944, which is \"vasculature development,\" but specifically for lumen formation, maybe \"tube formation\" or \"lumen development.\" Wait, GO:0048754 is \"branching involved in blood vessel morphogenesis,\" but maybe more precise. Alternatively, \"blood vessel morphogenesis\" is GO:0048514. Hmm, but the text specifically mentions lumen formation. Let me confirm. GO:0035295 is \"tube development,\" which includes lumen formation. Alternatively, \"lumen formation\" itself might have a specific term. Let me verify. Actually, GO:0048754 is \"branching involved in blood vessel morphogenesis,\" which is part of angiogenesis. But for lumen formation specifically, perhaps GO:0032528? No, that's microvillus organization. Wait, maybe \"cell-cell junction assembly\" or \"apical lumen assembly.\" Alternatively, \"epithelial tube formation\" is GO:0060563, but that's for epithelial. The text mentions blood vessels. Maybe \"vasculogenesis\" is GO:0001570, but that's the formation of the blood vessels themselves. Hmm. The text says \"lumen formation: the hollowing of vessels for blood perfusion.\" So maybe \"blood vessel lumen development\" is a term. Looking it up, I find that GO:0072520 is \"blood vessel lumen development.\" Perfect, so that's the GO term for lumen formation in blood vessels.\n\nNow, the mechanisms mentioned are vacuolation and cell-cell repulsion. Vacuolation involves intracellular vacuoles coalescing, which relates to vesicle-mediated transport or vacuole organization. GO:0007033 is \"vacuole organization.\" That's a good fit. For cell-cell repulsion, that's a bit trickier. Cell-cell adhesion regulation might be involved, but repulsion suggests something like \"cell-cell recognition\" or \"cell adhesion molecule activity.\" Alternatively, \"cell-cell junction assembly\" could be relevant, but repulsion might be part of morphogenesis. Maybe \"cell morphogenesis involved in differentiation\" (GO:0000904) or \"cell shape change\" (GO:0008360). The text mentions \"active cell shape changes,\" so GO:0008360 is \"regulation of cell shape.\" Alternatively, \"cell morphogenesis\" (GO:0000902). Let me check. Yes, \"cell morphogenesis involved in differentiation\" is GO:0000904. But the process here is about changing shape to form the lumen. Alternatively, \"cell-cell adhesion\" (GO:0098609) but in the context of repulsion. Maybe \"negative regulation of cell-cell adhesion\" (GO:0022408). But I need to check if that's accurate. Alternatively, \"cell-cell junction maintenance\" or similar. Wait, the repulsion mechanism involves active repulsion of adjacent cells, so perhaps \"cell-cell adhesion\" with a negative regulation. So GO:0022408 is \"negative regulation of cell-cell adhesion.\" That seems right.\n\nFor Cell Ontology, the text mentions blood vessels. The cells involved would be endothelial cells. So CL:0000115 is \"endothelial cell.\" Also, maybe \"epithelial cell\" if they're talking about epithelial tubes, but the text specifies blood vessels, which are endothelial. So CL:0000115 is correct.\n\nMeSH terms would include \"Angiogenesis\" which is D000096. Also, \"Blood Vessels\" as D001808. \"Endothelial Cells\" is D004727. \"Morphogenesis\" is D009030. \"Computer Simulation\" could be D003201, but the text mentions an agent-based computer model, so \"Models, Biological\" as D008957. Let me confirm. MeSH terms: \"Angiogenesis\" is D000096. \"Blood Vessels\" D001808. \"Endothelial Cells\" D004727. \"Morphogenesis\" D009030. \"Computer Simulation\" D003201. \"Models, Biological\" D008957. Since they used an agent-based model based on the cellular Potts model, \"Models, Biological\" is appropriate. Also, \"Sensitivity Analysis\" might be D012627, but that's a statistical method. However, the text mentions sensitivity analysis in the context of the model, so including \"Computer Simulation\" and \"Models, Biological\" makes sense.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nCellOntology: Endothelial cell (CL:0000115)\nGeneOntology: Angiogenesis (GO:0001525), Blood vessel lumen development (GO:0072520), Vacuole organization (GO:0007033), Negative regulation of cell-cell adhesion (GO:0022408), Regulation of cell shape (GO:0008360)\nMeSH: Angiogenesis (D000096), Blood Vessels (D001808), Endothelial Cells (D004727), Morphogenesis (D009030), Models, Biological (D008957), Computer Simulation (D003201)\n\nWait, the example includes only a few terms, but we need to ensure all are relevant. Let me check again. The text discusses two mechanisms: vacuolation and cell-cell repulsion. For vacuolation, \"vacuole organization\" (GO:0007033) is correct. For cell-cell repulsion, \"negative regulation of cell-cell adhesion\" (GO:0022408) and \"regulation of cell shape\" (GO:0008360) are appropriate. The main processes are angiogenesis and lumen formation, so those GO terms are essential.\n\nMeSH terms should cover the main concepts: Angiogenesis, Blood Vessels, Endothelial Cells, Morphogenesis, Models (Biological), Computer Simulation. Yes, these are all relevant.\n\nNow, formatting according to the requirements: exact category names, IDs without spaces, terms without extra spaces. Check each term's exact spelling and ID.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000115\",\n            \"term\": \"endothelial cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0001525\",\n            \"term\": \"angiogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0072520\",\n            \"term\": \"blood vessel lumen development\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007033\",\n            \"term\": \"vacuole organization\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0022408\",\n            \"term\": \"negative regulation of cell-cell adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0008360\",\n            \"term\": \"regulation of cell shape\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D000096\",\n            \"term\": \"Angiogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D001808\",\n            \"term\": \"Blood Vessels\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D004727\",\n            \"term\": \"Endothelial Cells\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D009030\",\n            \"term\": \"Morphogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D008957\",\n            \"term\": \"Models, Biological\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D003201\",\n            \"term\": \"Computer Simulation\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a CompuCell3D simulation Python file based on the given ontology annotations. Let me start by recalling the structure of a typical CompuCell3D script.\n\nFirst, the required imports. The user mentioned including CompuCellSetup and steppables. So I'll import those, and probably some modules like cc3d for core functionalities.\n\nNext, the simulation class that inherits from SteppableBasePy. That means I need to create a class, probably named something like AngiogenesisSimulation, which extends steppables.SteppableBasePy. The class needs __init__, start, and step methods.\n\nIn the __init__ method, I should call the parent class's __init__ using super(). The start method is where initial setup happens, like setting up cell types and maybe initial cells. The step method will handle actions taken each simulation step.\n\nLooking at the ontology annotations: the cell type is endothelial cells. So I need to define that cell type in CompuCell3D. Maybe set up a basic simulation where these cells exhibit behaviors related to angiogenesis, regulation of cell shape, etc.\n\nFor the Gene Ontology terms: angiogenesis involves blood vessel development. So parameters related to cell migration, adhesion, maybe chemotaxis. Regulation of cell shape could involve volume and surface constraints. Vacuole organization might not directly translate, but perhaps adjust internal cell parameters. Blood vessel lumen development could involve cell arrangement forming lumens, maybe using chemotaxis towards a growth factor. Negative regulation of cell-cell adhesion suggests lower adhesion between cells, so adjusting adhesion parameters.\n\nMeSH terms include biological models, angiogenesis, morphogenesis, blood vessels, etc. So the simulation should model blood vessel formation through angiogenesis, with endothelial cells migrating and forming tubular structures.\n\nNow, putting this into code. The start method should define the endothelial cell type. Using the simulator object to assign cell types and their properties. Maybe set up a few initial cells. For parameters, set the volume and surface constraints to regulate cell shape. Adhesion energy should be lower to reduce cell-cell adhesion. Maybe include a chemical field for chemotaxis to guide angiogenesis.\n\nIn the step method, perhaps apply a chemotaxis force each step. Check if the simulation step is within a certain range to apply some behavior, like secreting a chemical. But the example might be basic, just showing the structure.\n\nI need to make sure all the required parts are included: imports, simulation class with the three methods, cell types based on the ontology, and parameters that align with the GO terms. Let me structure the code step by step.\n\nImports: from cc3d.core.PyCoreSpecs import * for specifying the simulation, and CompuCellSetup, plus steppables.\n\nIn the specs, define the cell type 'Endothelial' with appropriate volume, surface, adhesion, and chemotaxis parameters. Then, set up the simulation with these specs. The steppable class will handle the initial cells and any dynamic behavior each step.\n\nWait, in CompuCell3D, the standard way is to create a simulation script that defines the cell types, initializes the simulation grid, and applies various plugins and steppables. So perhaps in the start method, I'll create some initial endothelial cells. In the step method, maybe adjust something periodically.\n\nAlso, the user wants the code to include basic cell types and parameters based on the ontology. So for endothelial cells, parameters related to adhesion (negative regulation of cell-cell adhesion), volume (cell shape), chemotaxis (angiogenesis), etc.\n\nPutting it all together, the code would start with imports, then define the simulation class with __init__, start, and step. In start, initialize cells. In step, maybe do nothing except increment a step counter, but include a placeholder for applying chemotaxis or adjusting adhesion.\n\nWait, but the actual parameters like adhesion, volume constraints, and chemotaxis are usually set in the CC3DML or via the specs in Python. Since the user wants a Python file, maybe using the newer Python-based specification (PyCoreSpecs) to set up the simulation parameters.\n\nBut the traditional way is to use XML (CC3DML), but the user asked for a Python script. So perhaps using the Python-based setup without XML. Let me structure the code accordingly.\n\nSo, the code would start with:\n\nimport cc3d.CompuCellSetup as CompuCellSetup\nfrom cc3d.core.PyCoreSpecs import *\n\nThen, create a simulation specification:\n\nsim = CC3DSim()\n...\n\nBut maybe the user expects the traditional steppable approach. Let me check. The user mentioned a simulation class that inherits from steppables.SteppableBasePy. So the code would have a class like:\n\nclass AngiogenesisSteppable(steppables.SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, frequency=1):\n        super().__init__(frequency)\n        ...\n\n    def start(self):\n        # setup cell types\n        self.cell_type = self.create_cell_type(\"Endothelial\")\n        ...\n\n    def step(self, mcs):\n        # actions each step\n        ...\n\nThen, registering the steppable with CompuCellSetup.\n\nBut to set parameters like adhesion, volume, etc., those are typically done via XML or through the Python specs. Maybe in the start method, using the simulator interface.\n\nAlternatively, using the Potts section to set dimensions, steps, etc.\n\nPutting this all together, here's a possible code outline:\n\nImports:\nimport cc3d.CompuCellSetup as CompuCellSetup\nfrom cc3d.core.PyCoreSpecs import *\nfrom cc3d.steppables import SteppableBasePy\n\nDefine the simulation specs (cell types, volume, adhesion, chemotaxis), then a steppable class that initializes cells and maybe applies some behavior each step.\n\nBut to fit the user's request of including the required methods (__init__, start, step) in a simulation class, perhaps the code should look like this:\n\nclass AngiogenesisSimulation(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, frequency=1):\n        super().__init__(frequency)\n    \n    def start(self):\n        # Set up cell types\n        self.endothelial_type = self.cell_type_plugin.TypeData(self.cell_type_plugin.ENDOTHELIAL)\n        # Maybe set parameters here, or in the specs\n        # Create initial cells\n        cell = self.new_cell(self.endothelial_type)\n        self.cell_field[0,0,0] = cell\n    \n    def step(self, mcs):\n        # Example: secrete a chemical every 10 steps\n        if mcs % 10 == 0:\n            self.chemical_field.secrete(...)\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact methods. Alternatively, using the specs to define parameters.\n\nAlternatively, the user might expect a script that uses the PyCoreSpecs to set up the simulation parameters, and then a steppable class for dynamic behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together, here's a possible code:\n\nimport cc3d.CompuCellSetup as CompuCellSetup\nfrom cc3d.core.PyCoreSpecs import *\nfrom cc3d.steppables import SteppableBasePy\n\n# Simulation specification\nsim = CC3DSim()\nsim.register_steppable(steppable=AngiogenesisSteppable(frequency=1))\nCompuCellSetup.run_cc3d(sim)\n\nWait, no, the code should define the steppable class and then register it. Let me structure it properly.\n\nThe complete code would be:\n\nimport cc3d.CompuCellSetup as CompuCellSetup\nfrom cc3d.core.PyCoreSpecs import *\nfrom cc3d.steppables import SteppableBasePy\n\n# Define the simulation parameters\nsim = CC3DSim()\n\n# Create cell type\ncell_type_spec = CellTypePluginSpec()\ncell_type_spec.types.append('Endothelial')\nsim.register_spec(cell_type_spec)\n\n# Volume constraint\nvolume_spec = VolumePluginSpec()\nvolume_spec.params['Endothelial'] = VolumePluginSpec.VolumeParam(target_volume=25, lambda_volume=2.0)\nsim.register_spec(volume_spec)\n\n# Adhesion parameters\nadhesion_spec = ContactPluginSpec(neighbor_order=2)\nadhesion_spec.params['Endothelial', 'Endothelial'] = 10  # Lower adhesion for negative regulation\nadhesion_spec.params['Endothelial', 'Medium'] = 16\nsim.register_spec(adhesion_spec)\n\n# Chemotaxis for angiogenesis\nchemotaxis_spec = ChemotaxisPluginSpec()\nchem_spec = ChemicalFieldSpec(cell_type='Endothelial', concentration=20.0, decay=0.1, diffusion_coefficient=0.1)\nsim.register_spec(chem_spec)\nchemo_params = ChemotaxisDataSpec(field_name='Chemical', cell_types=['Endothelial'])\nchemo_params.add_lambda('Endothelial', 100)\nchemotaxis_spec.data.append(chemo_params)\nsim.register_spec(chemotaxis_spec)\n\n# Steppable\nclass AngiogenesisSteppable(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, frequency=1):\n        super().__init__(frequency)\n    \n    def start(self):\n        # Create initial endothelial cells\n        for i in range(10):\n            cell = self.new_cell('Endothelial')\n            self.cell_field["

MeSH terms: \"Angiogenesis\" is D000096. \"Blood Vessels\" D001808. \"Endothelial Cells\" D004727. \"Morphogenesis\" D009030. \"Computer Simulation\" D003201. \"Models, Biological\" D008957. Since they used an agent-based model based on the cellular Potts model, \"Models, Biological\" is appropriate. Also, \"Sensitivity Analysis\" might be D012627, but that's a statistical method. However, the text mentions sensitivity analysis in the context of the model, so including \"Computer Simulation\" and \"Models, Biological\" makes sense.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nCellOntology: Endothelial cell (CL:0000115)\nGeneOntology: Angiogenesis (GO:0001525), Blood vessel lumen development (GO:0072520), Vacuole organization (GO:0007033), Negative regulation of cell-cell adhesion (GO:0022408), Regulation of cell shape (GO:0008360)\nMeSH: Angiogenesis (D000096), Blood Vessels (D001808), Endothelial Cells (D004727), Morphogenesis (D009030), Models, Biological (D008957), Computer Simulation (D003201)\n\nWait, the example includes only a few terms, but we need to ensure all are relevant. Let me check again. The text discusses two mechanisms: vacuolation and cell-cell repulsion. For vacuolation, \"vacuole organization\" (GO:0007033) is correct. For cell-cell repulsion, \"negative regulation of cell-cell adhesion\" (GO:0022408) and \"regulation of cell shape\" (GO:0008360) are appropriate. The main processes are angiogenesis and lumen formation, so those GO terms are essential.\n\nMeSH terms should cover the main concepts: Angiogenesis, Blood Vessels, Endothelial Cells, Morphogenesis, Models (Biological), Computer Simulation. Yes, these are all relevant.\n\nNow, formatting according to the requirements: exact category names, IDs without spaces, terms without extra spaces. Check each term's exact spelling and ID.\n</think>",

      "python_code": "from cc3d.core.PySteppables import *\n\n<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a CompuCell3D simulation Python file based on the given ontology annotations. Let me start by recalling the structure of a typical CompuCell3D script.\n\nFirst, the required imports. The user mentioned including CompuCellSetup and steppables. So I'll import those, and probably some modules like cc3d for core functionalities.\n\nNext, the simulation class that inherits from SteppableBasePy. That means I need to create a class, probably named something like AngiogenesisSimulation, which extends steppables.SteppableBasePy. The class needs __init__, start, and step methods.\n\nIn the __init__ method, I should call the parent class's __init__ using super(). The start method is where initial setup happens, like setting up cell types and maybe initial cells. The step method will handle actions taken each simulation step.\n\nLooking at the ontology annotations: the cell type is endothelial cells. So I need to define that cell type in CompuCell3D. Maybe set up a basic simulation where these cells exhibit behaviors related to angiogenesis, regulation of cell shape, etc.\n\nFor the Gene Ontology terms: angiogenesis involves blood vessel development. So parameters related to cell migration, adhesion, maybe chemotaxis. Regulation of cell shape could involve volume and surface constraints. Vacuole organization might not directly translate, but perhaps adjust internal cell parameters. Blood vessel lumen development could involve cell arrangement forming lumens, maybe using chemotaxis towards a growth factor. Negative regulation of cell-cell adhesion suggests lower adhesion between cells, so adjusting adhesion parameters.\n\nMeSH terms include biological models, angiogenesis, morphogenesis, blood vessels, etc. So the simulation should model blood vessel formation through angiogenesis, with endothelial cells migrating and forming tubular structures.\n\nNow, putting this into code. The start method should define the endothelial cell type. Using the simulator object to assign cell types and their properties. Maybe set up a few initial cells. For parameters, set the volume and surface constraints to regulate cell shape. Adhesion energy should be lower to reduce cell-cell adhesion. Maybe include a chemical field for chemotaxis to guide angiogenesis.\n\nIn the step method, perhaps apply a chemotaxis force each step. Check if the simulation step is within a certain range to apply some behavior, like secreting a chemical. But the example might be basic, just showing the structure.\n\nI need to make sure all the required parts are included: imports, simulation class with the three methods, cell types based on the ontology, and parameters that align with the GO terms. Let me structure the code step by step.\n\nImports: from cc3d.core.PyCoreSpecs import * for specifying the simulation, and CompuCellSetup, plus steppables.\n\nIn the specs, define the cell type 'Endothelial' with appropriate volume, surface, adhesion, and chemotaxis parameters. Then, set up the simulation with these specs. The steppable class will handle the initial cells and any dynamic behavior each step.\n\nWait, in CompuCell3D, the standard way is to create a simulation script that defines the cell types, initializes the simulation grid, and applies various plugins and steppables. So perhaps in the start method, I'll create some initial endothelial cells. In the step method, maybe adjust something periodically.\n\nAlso, the user wants the code to include basic cell types and parameters based on the ontology. So for endothelial cells, parameters related to adhesion (negative regulation of cell-cell adhesion), volume (cell shape), chemotaxis (angiogenesis), etc.\n\nPutting it all together, the code would start with imports, then define the simulation class with __init__, start, and step. In start, initialize cells. In step, maybe do nothing except increment a step counter, but include a placeholder for applying chemotaxis or adjusting adhesion.\n\nWait, but the actual parameters like adhesion, volume constraints, and chemotaxis are usually set in the CC3DML or via the specs in Python. Since the user wants a Python file, maybe using the newer Python-based specification (PyCoreSpecs) to set up the simulation parameters.\n\nBut the traditional way is to use XML (CC3DML), but the user asked for a Python script. So perhaps using the Python-based setup without XML. Let me structure the code accordingly.\n\nSo, the code would start with:\n\nimport cc3d.CompuCellSetup as CompuCellSetup\nfrom cc3d.core.PyCoreSpecs import *\n\nThen, create a simulation specification:\n\nsim = CC3DSim()\n...\n\nBut maybe the user expects the traditional steppable approach. Let me check. The user mentioned a simulation class that inherits from steppables.SteppableBasePy. So the code would have a class like:\n\nclass AngiogenesisSteppable(steppables.SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, frequency=1):\n        super().__init__(frequency)\n        ...\n\n    def start(self):\n        # setup cell types\n        self.cell_type = self.create_cell_type(\"Endothelial\")\n        ...\n\n    def step(self, mcs):\n        # actions each step\n        ...\n\nThen, registering the steppable with CompuCellSetup.\n\nBut to set parameters like adhesion, volume, etc., those are typically done via XML or through the Python specs. Maybe in the start method, using the simulator interface.\n\nAlternatively, using the Potts section to set dimensions, steps, etc.\n\nPutting this all together, here's a possible code outline:\n\nImports:\nimport cc3d.CompuCellSetup as CompuCellSetup\nfrom cc3d.core.PyCoreSpecs import *\nfrom cc3d.steppables import SteppableBasePy\n\nDefine the simulation specs (cell types, volume, adhesion, chemotaxis), then a steppable class that initializes cells and maybe applies some behavior each step.\n\nBut to fit the user's request of including the required methods (__init__, start, step) in a simulation class, perhaps the code should look like this:\n\nclass AngiogenesisSimulation(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, frequency=1):\n        super().__init__(frequency)\n    \n    def start(self):\n        # Set up cell types\n        self.endothelial_type = self.cell_type_plugin.TypeData(self.cell_type_plugin.ENDOTHELIAL)\n        # Maybe set parameters here, or in the specs\n        # Create initial cells\n        cell = self.new_cell(self.endothelial_type)\n        self.cell_field[0,0,0] = cell\n    \n    def step(self, mcs):\n        # Example: secrete a chemical every 10 steps\n        if mcs % 10 == 0:\n            self.chemical_field.secrete(...)\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact methods. Alternatively, using the specs to define parameters.\n\nAlternatively, the user might expect a script that uses the PyCoreSpecs to set up the simulation parameters, and then a steppable class for dynamic behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together, here's a possible code:\n\nimport cc3d.CompuCellSetup as CompuCellSetup\nfrom cc3d.core.PyCoreSpecs import *\nfrom cc3d.steppables import SteppableBasePy\n\n# Simulation specification\nsim = CC3DSim()\nsim.register_steppable(steppable=AngiogenesisSteppable(frequency=1))\nCompuCellSetup.run_cc3d(sim)\n\nWait, no, the code should define the steppable class and then register it. Let me structure it properly.\n\nThe complete code would be:\n\nimport cc3d.CompuCellSetup as CompuCellSetup\nfrom cc3d.core.PyCoreSpecs import *\nfrom cc3d.steppables import SteppableBasePy\n\n# Define the simulation parameters\nsim = CC3DSim()\n\n# Create cell type\ncell_type_spec = CellTypePluginSpec()\ncell_type_spec.types.append('Endothelial')\nsim.register_spec(cell_type_spec)\n\n# Volume constraint\nvolume_spec = VolumePluginSpec()\nvolume_spec.params['Endothelial'] = VolumePluginSpec.VolumeParam(target_volume=25, lambda_volume=2.0)\nsim.register_spec(volume_spec)\n\n# Adhesion parameters\nadhesion_spec = ContactPluginSpec(neighbor_order=2)\nadhesion_spec.params['Endothelial', 'Endothelial'] = 10  # Lower adhesion for negative regulation\nadhesion_spec.params['Endothelial', 'Medium'] = 16\nsim.register_spec(adhesion_spec)\n\n# Chemotaxis for angiogenesis\nchemotaxis_spec = ChemotaxisPluginSpec()\nchem_spec = ChemicalFieldSpec(cell_type='Endothelial', concentration=20.0, decay=0.1, diffusion_coefficient=0.1)\nsim.register_spec(chem_spec)\nchemo_params = ChemotaxisDataSpec(field_name='Chemical', cell_types=['Endothelial'])\nchemo_params.add_lambda('Endothelial', 100)\nchemotaxis_spec.data.append(chemo_params)\nsim.register_spec(chemotaxis_spec)\n\n# Steppable\nclass AngiogenesisSteppable(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, frequency=1):\n        super().__init__(frequency)\n    \n    def start(self):\n        # Create initial endothelial cells\n        for i in range(10):\n            cell = self.new_cell('Endothelial')\n            self.cell_field[",
