      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to create structured ontology annotations for COMPUCELL3D based on the provided information. They specified Cell Ontology, Gene Ontology, and MeSH terms. I need to make sure I follow the exact category names, ID formats, and term names without any extra spaces.\n\nFirst, looking at the original description. COMPUCELL3D is for 3D simulation of morphogenesis, uses models for cell clustering, growth, interactions with chemical fields. It's verified with a model of growth and skeletal pattern formation in chicken limb buds.\n\nFor CellOntology: The software models cell clustering and interactions. Terms related to cell types involved in morphogenesis. Epithelial and mesenchymal cells are key in developmental processes. Check Cell Ontology for their IDs. Epithelial is CL:0000066 and Mesenchymal is CL:0008019. Need to confirm those are the exact terms and IDs.\n\nGeneOntology: The processes mentioned are morphogenesis, cell division, cell adhesion, and pattern specification. Morphogenesis is GO:0009653. Cell division is GO:0051301. Cell adhesion is GO:0007155. Skeletal system development might be GO:0001501. Need to check if these are the exact terms and IDs.\n\nMeSH terms: The software deals with morphogenesis (D009024), cell proliferation (D002460), limb bud (D058628), and computational biology (D019296). Make sure the IDs match. Morphogenesis is D009024, Cell Proliferation is D002460, Limb Bud is D058628, and Computational Biology is D019296. Check if those are correct.\n\nNow, I need to structure the JSON exactly as per the example. Categories must be \"CellOntology\", \"GeneOntology\", \"MeSH\" without any variations. IDs without spaces, terms correctly capitalized and spelled.\n\nDouble-check all the IDs and terms. For example, \"Cell Division\" is the correct term for GO:0051301. \"Skeletal system development\" is GO:0001501. \"Pattern specification\" might need a different GO term, maybe \"pattern formation\" (GO:0003002) but the original text says \"skeletal pattern formation\", so maybe \"skeletal system morphogenesis\" (GO:0048705)? Wait, the verification was on growth and skeletal pattern formation. Maybe \"pattern specification process\" (GO:0007389) or \"regionalization\" (GO:0003002). Hmm. The original mentions \"skeletal pattern formation\", so perhaps \"skeletal system morphogenesis\" (GO:0048705) is better. Or \"anatomical structure formation involved in morphogenesis\" (GO:0048646). Alternatively, \"pattern specification\" as in GO:0007389. Need to verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the limb bud development involves \"limb morphogenesis\" (GO:0060173). But the example given was skeletal pattern formation. Let me check. The GO term for \"skeletal system morphogenesis\" is GO:0048705. Yes, that's correct. So perhaps include that. But the original description mentions \"skeletal pattern formation\", so maybe \"pattern formation\" (GO:0003002) which is \"pattern formation\" in general. Alternatively, check if there's a more specific term. Alternatively, maybe \"anatomical structure formation involved in morphogenesis\" (GO:0048646). Hmm. Alternatively, the user might have intended \"pattern specification\", so I'll go with that for now, but need to verify. Alternatively, maybe \"skeletal system development\" (GO:0001501) is sufficient.\n\nFor MeSH, \"Limb Bud\" is D058628. Yes. \"Computational Biology\" is D019296. Correct.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nCellOntology: Epithelial (CL:0000066), Mesenchymal (CL:0008019).\n\nGeneOntology: Morphogenesis (GO:0009653), Cell Division (GO:0051301), Cell Adhesion (GO:0007155), Skeletal System Development (GO:0001501), maybe Pattern Specification (GO:0007389) or another term. Wait, the verification model includes \"skeletal pattern formation\". So perhaps \"skeletal system morphogenesis\" (GO:0048705). Let me check GO:0048705: \"skeletal system morphogenesis\", which is part of skeletal system development. So including GO:0001501 (skeletal system development) and GO:0048705 (skeletal system morphogenesis). But need to see which terms are more appropriate. The original mentions \"skeletal pattern formation\", which is part of morphogenesis, so maybe GO:0048705. However, the example given in the prompt for GeneOntology includes \"Cell Division\". Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, \"pattern specification\" (GO:0007389) is part of the regionalization process. But the original text says \"skeletal pattern formation\", which is morphogenesis. So perhaps GO:0048705. Let me confirm.\n\nGO:0048705 is \"skeletal system morphogenesis\". That's correct. So maybe that's a better fit. But in the original description, the model is about \"growth and skeletal pattern formation\". So maybe \"skeletal system morphogenesis\" (GO:0048705) and \"growth\" (GO:0040007). But growth is a broad term. Alternatively, \"cell growth\" (GO:0016049) or \"developmental growth\" (GO:0048589). The original mentions \"growth\" in the context of the limb bud model. So perhaps including \"developmental growth\" (GO:0048589). But I need to check if that's the correct term.\n\nAlternatively, the software employs models for cell growth. So \"cell growth\" (GO:0016049). So for GeneOntology terms: Cell Division (GO:0051301), Cell Adhesion (GO:0007155), Morphogenesis (GO:0009653), Cell Growth (GO:0016049), Skeletal System Morphogenesis (GO:0048705). But need to verify IDs.\n\nWait, the original description says \"biologically relevant models for cell clustering, growth, and interaction with chemical fields\". So cell clustering might relate to cell adhesion or cell-cell adhesion. Growth could be cell growth (GO:0016049) or developmental growth. So including Cell Growth (GO:0016049). Skeletal pattern formation in the verification model would be covered by skeletal system morphogenesis (GO:0048705). \n\nSo GeneOntology entries would be:\n\n- Morphogenesis (GO:0009653)\n- Cell Division (GO:0051301)\n- Cell Adhesion (GO:0007155)\n- Cell Growth (GO:0016049)\n- Skeletal System Morphogenesis (GO:0048705)\n\nMeSH terms:\n\n- Morphogenesis (D009024)\n- Cell Proliferation (D002460)\n- Limb Bud (D058628)\n- Computational Biology (D019296)\n\nNow, assemble the JSON, ensuring correct category names, IDs without spaces, exact term names. Check for any typos. For example, \"GeneOntology\" not \"Gene Ontology\". IDs like CL:0000066, GO:0009653, D009024, etc.\n\nSo the final JSON should look like this:\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000066\",\n            \"term\": \"Epithelial\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0008019\",\n            \"term\": \"Mesenchymal\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0009653\",\n            \"term\": \"Morphogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0051301\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Division\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007155\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0016049\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Growth\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0048705\",\n            \"term\": \"Skeletal System Morphogenesis\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D009024\",\n            \"term\": \"Morphogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002460\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Proliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D058628\",\n            \"term\": \"Limb Bud\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D019296\",\n            \"term\": \"Computational Biology\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"
