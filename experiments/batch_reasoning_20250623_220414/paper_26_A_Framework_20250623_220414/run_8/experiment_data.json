Cell Ontology terms might include limb bud cells. Checking CL, \"Limb bud cell\" is CL:0000352.\n\nFor Gene Ontology, processes like cell division, morphogenesis, pattern specification. The model involves growth and skeletal pattern formation. GO terms: \"Cell division\" is GO:0051301, \"Morphogenesis\" is GO:0009653, and \"Pattern specification\" is GO:0007389.\n\nMeSH terms should relate to the biological processes modeled. \"Morphogenesis\" is D009048, \"Cell Proliferation\" is D049109, and \"Limb Bud\" is D054058.\n\nNeed to ensure exact category names, IDs without spaces, and correct term names.
