Upon encountering antigen presenting cells, T-cell receptor activation promotes the differentiation of na\u00efve CD8 T-cells into strongly proliferating activated and effector stages.

Coupling this molecular model to the cellular scale successfully reproduces qualitatively the evolution of total CD8 T-cell counts observed in mice lymph node, between Day 3 and 5.5 post-infection.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by breaking down the original description to identify relevant terms for each ontology.\n\nFirst, the main cell type mentioned is CD8 T-cells. I need to find the correct Cell Ontology ID and term. Searching Cell Ontology, \"CD8-positive, alpha-beta T cell\" has the ID CL:0000625. So that's for CellOntology.\n\nNext, Gene Ontology terms. The description talks about T-cell receptor activation, differentiation, cell apoptosis. Possible GO terms: T-cell activation (GO:0042110), cell differentiation (GO:0030154), apoptotic process (GO:0006915), cell proliferation (GO:0008283), and maybe interleukin-2 receptor activity (GO:0004916) since IL2 receptor is mentioned. Need to verify the exact terms and IDs.\n\nFor MeSH, terms related to T-cells, apoptosis, Fas-Fas ligand. MeSH terms might be \"CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes\" (D053508), \"Apoptosis\" (D017209), \"Fas Ligand Protein\" (D050356), \"Cell Proliferation\" (D002460), and \"Lymph Nodes\" (D008198) since the lymph node is mentioned as the site.\n\nWait, the example uses \"MeSH\" category, so need to check exact term names. Let me confirm each ID and term:\n\n- CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes: MeSH D053508. Term is \"CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes\".\n- Apoptosis: D017209.\n- Fas Ligand Protein: D050356.\n- Cell Proliferation: D002460. Term is \"Cell Proliferation\".\n- Lymph Nodes: D008198.\n\nFor Gene Ontology:\n- T-cell activation: GO:0042110. Term \"T cell activation\".\n- Cell differentiation: GO:0030154. Term \"cell differentiation\".\n- Apoptotic process: GO:0006915. Term \"apoptotic process\".\n- Cell proliferation: GO:0008283. Term \"cell proliferation\".\n- Interleukin-2 receptor activity: GO:0004916. Term \"interleukin-2 receptor activity\".\n\nAlso, caspases are involved in apoptosis. There's a GO term for caspase activity, like \"cysteine-type endopeptidase activity involved in apoptotic process\" (GO:0097153), but maybe \"apoptotic process\" is sufficient here. The description mentions caspases and Fas-FasL interactions controlling apoptosis, so including the apoptotic process term makes sense.\n\nCheck if \"molecular pathway\" or \"cellular Potts model\" have MeSH terms, but probably not. Focus on the key terms mentioned.\n\nPutting it all together. Ensure category names are exact, IDs without spaces, terms correctly capitalized and spaced.\n\nDouble-check each ID and term against the respective ontologies to avoid errors. For example, Fas Ligand Protein in MeSH is correct. The model mentions lymph node, so include that in MeSH as well.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000625\",\n            \"term\": \"CD8-positive, alpha-beta T cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0042110\",\n            \"term\": \"T cell activation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0030154\",\n            \"term\": \"cell differentiation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0006915\",\n            \"term\": \"apoptotic process\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0008283\",\n            \"term\": \"cell proliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0004916\",\n            \"term\": \"interleukin-2 receptor activity\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D053508\",\n            \"term\": \"CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D017209\",\n            \"term\": \"Apoptosis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D050356\",\n            \"term\": \"Fas Ligand Protein\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002460\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Proliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D008198\",\n            \"term\": \"Lymph Nodes\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"

The user specified that the code must include required imports, a simulation class inheriting from SteppableBasePy, and the __init__, start, and step methods. Also, the cell types and parameters should be based on the given ontology terms.\n\nFirst, the imports. CompuCellSetup is always needed, and steppables from cc3d. So I'll import those.\n\nNext, the simulation class. It should inherit from steppables.SteppableBasePy. The __init__ method should call the parent's __init__. The start method is where I set up the initial cells, and step is for actions each simulation step.\n\nLooking at the CellOntology, there's a CD8+ T cell. So I'll define that as a cell type. The GeneOntology terms include interleukin-2 receptor activity, differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and T cell activation. MeSH terms include Fas Ligand, Apoptosis, Proliferation, Lymph Nodes. \n\nI need to translate these into cell properties. For example, apoptosis could be modeled with a probability of death. Proliferation might involve a cell dividing after a certain time. Differentiation could change cell type. T cell activation might modify parameters like motility or secretion.\n\nIn the start method, I should create some CD8+ T cells. Maybe place them randomly in the simulation area. Then, in the step method, handle events like proliferation, apoptosis, and activation.\n\nFor parameters, each cell could have attributes like proliferation_rate, apoptosis_prob, il2_receptor_level, fas_ligand. During step, check if a cell's apoptosis_prob is exceeded by a random number, then kill it. For proliferation, increment a counter and divide when it reaches a threshold. Activation could be triggered by some condition, like encountering a certain signal, but maybe for simplicity, just a time-based activation here.\n\nI should also set up the simulation with CompuCellSetup.register_steppable and run it with CompuCellSetup.run.\n\nWait, the user mentioned to include basic cell types and parameters based on the ontology. So CD8+ T cells are the main type. Maybe set their apoptosis probability, proliferation rate, and other attributes in the start method when creating them.\n\nAlso, the volume parameters like TargetVolume and LambdaVolume are necessary for cell growth in CC3D. So each cell should have those set.\n\nPutting it all together: imports, simulation class with init, start, step. In start, create cells with initial properties. In step, handle apoptosis, proliferation, and maybe activation.\n\nNeed to make sure all the required ontology terms are represented. Fas Ligand might be a secretion or a property affecting apoptosis. For simplicity, maybe just track it as a cell attribute. Similarly, interleukin-2 receptor activity could influence proliferation.\n\nSo in code:\n\n- Define cell type 'CD8T' using p_type.\n- In start, create cells of type CD8T, set TargetVolume, LambdaVolume, apoptosis_prob, proliferation_clock, etc.\n- In step, loop through each cell, check if apoptosis occurs, update proliferation_clock, divide when needed.
