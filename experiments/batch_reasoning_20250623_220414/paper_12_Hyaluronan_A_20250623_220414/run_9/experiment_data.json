        "description": "During embryonic development, cardiac valves arise at specific regions in the cardiac endothelium that swell up due to enhanced extracellular matrix production (so-called endocardial cushions). An important extracellular matrix component that is produced by the endocardial cells is the glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan. A deficiency in hyaluronan synthesis results in a failure to form endocardial cushions and a loss of their cellularization by a process called endothelial-to-mesenchymal transformation. Expression of the major hyaluronan synthase Has2 is under the influence of both positive and negative regulators. MicroRNA-dependent degradation of Has2 is required to control extracellular hyaluronan levels and thereby the size of the endocardial cushions. In this article, we review the current literature on hyaluronan synthesis during cardiac valve formation and propose that a balanced activity of both positive and negative regulators is required to maintain the critical homeostasis of hyaluronan levels in the extracellular matrix and thereby the size of the endocardial cushions. The activating and inhibitory interactions between microRNA-23, Has2, and hyaluronan are reminiscent of a reaction\u2013diffusion system. Using a mathematical modeling approach we show that the system can produce a confined expression of hyaluronan, but only if the inhibitory signal is transferred to adjacent cells in exosomes."

      "response": "<think>\nAlright, let me tackle this request step by step. The user wants structured ontology annotations based on the provided biological description. They specified using CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH terms, each in their own categories with exact IDs and terms.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original description to identify key elements. The text discusses cardiac valve development, endocardial cushions, extracellular matrix components like hyaluronan, and processes such as endothelial-to-mesenchymal transformation (EMT). There's mention of Has2 (hyaluronan synthase 2), microRNA-23, exosomes, and reaction-diffusion systems.\n\nStarting with CellOntology. The endocardial cushions are formed from endocardial cells. The term \"endocardial cell\" is likely in Cell Ontology. Checking, CL:0002251 is the correct ID for endocardial cell. Also, during EMT, endothelial cells transform into mesenchymal cells. So \"Endothelial Cell\" (CL:0000115) and \"Mesenchymal Cell\" (CL:0008020) should be included.\n\nNext, GeneOntology. The process involves extracellular matrix production, so \"extracellular matrix organization\" (GO:0030198) is relevant. Hyaluronan biosynthesis (GO:0030212) directly relates to Has2. EMT is part of \"endothelial to mesenchymal transition\" (GO:0060973). MicroRNA activity falls under \"gene silencing by miRNA\" (GO:0035195). Exosomes are involved in \"exosome secretion\" (GO:0071699). The reaction-diffusion system might map to \"pattern specification\" (GO:0007389).\n\nFor MeSH terms, \"Endocardial Cushions\" (D017128) is a given. \"Hyaluronic Acid\" (D006820) is the major component discussed. \"Endothelial-Mesenchymal Transition\" (D060687) corresponds to EMT. \"MicroRNAs\" (D037381) and \"Exosomes\" (D055354) are explicitly mentioned. \"Extracellular Matrix\" (D005109) is a key component here. \n\nI need to ensure all IDs are correctly formatted without spaces and terms are exact. Cross-checking each term and ID against the respective ontologies to confirm accuracy. For example, verifying that GO:0030212 is indeed hyaluronan biosynthetic process. Also, ensuring MeSH terms like D060687 for Endothelial-Mesenchymal Transition are correct.\n\nFinally, structuring the JSON with the exact category names and correct arrays. Making sure there are no typos or extra spaces. Each entry has \"id\" and \"term\" fields. Avoiding any additional explanations as per the user's instruction.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0002251\",\n            \"term\": \"endocardial cell\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000115\",\n            \"term\": \"Endothelial Cell\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0008020\",\n            \"term\": \"Mesenchymal Cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0030198\",\n            \"term\": \"extracellular matrix organization\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0030212\",\n            \"term\": \"hyaluronan biosynthetic process\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0060973\",\n            \"term\": \"endothelial to mesenchymal transition\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0035195\",\n            \"term\": \"gene silencing by miRNA\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0071699\",\n            \"term\": \"exosome secretion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007389\",\n            \"term\": \"pattern specification\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D017128\",\n            \"term\": \"Endocardial Cushions\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D006820\",\n            \"term\": \"Hyaluronic Acid\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D060687\",\n            \"term\": \"Endothelial-Mesenchymal Transition\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D037381\",\n            \"term\": \"MicroRNAs\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D055354\",\n            \"term\": \"Exosomes\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D005109\",\n            \"term\": \"Extracellular Matrix\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"

Also, basic cell types and parameters based on the given ontologies.\n\nFirst, the imports. CompuCellSetup is necessary, and steppables from the cc3d module. So I'll import those. Then, create a simulation class that inherits from SteppableBasePy. The class needs __init__ where I call the parent's __init__. The start method is for initial setup, and step for actions each simulation step.\n\nThe ontology annotations include three cell types: Endothelial, Mesenchymal, and endocardial. So in the start method, I should define these cell types using the cellType property. Maybe assign different colors for visualization.\n\nLooking at the Gene Ontology terms, there's processes like gene silencing by miRNA, hyaluronan biosynthesis, pattern specification, endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EndMT), ECM organization, exosome secretion. These might translate into specific simulation parameters. For example, Endothelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EndMT) could be modeled by changing cell type under certain conditions. Maybe in the step method, check conditions for transition.\n\nMeSH terms include Extracellular Matrix, Exosomes, Hyaluronic Acid. So perhaps parameters related to ECM, like adhesion or secretion. The ECM organization could affect cell interactions. Maybe set different adhesion energies between cell types and the ECM.\n\nHyaluronic Acid is part of the ECM, so maybe cells can secrete a chemical corresponding to it. The simulation might need a field for hyaluronan. Similarly, exosomes could be another secretion, but maybe that's more complex. For simplicity, perhaps focus on hyaluronan.\n\nIn the __init__ method, I should set up the simulation parameters. For example, setting adhesion energies between cell types, or parameters influencing EndMT. Maybe add a chemical field for hyaluronan using the createScalarFieldCellLevelPy call.\n\nIn the step method, implement checks for EndMT. For example, if an endothelial cell reaches a certain condition (like being in a region with high hyaluronan), change its type to mesenchymal. Also, update secretion of hyaluronan based on cell type.\n\nWait, the user mentioned to include basic parameters based on the ontology. So adhesion, maybe secretion rates, and transition conditions.\n\nPutting this together: In the start method, define the three cell types. In __init__, initialize necessary fields and parameters.
