      "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a JSON object with ontology annotations based on the provided information. Let's start by parsing the original description and identifying relevant terms for each ontology category: CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH.\n\nFirst, the paper discusses Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). So \"Epithelial\" and \"Mesenchymal\" are cell types, which belong to Cell Ontology. Checking the Cell Ontology (CL) terms, I recall that \"Epithelial Cell\" has an ID like CL:0000066 and \"Mesenchymal Cell\" is CL:0008019.\n\nNext, Gene Ontology (GO) terms. The processes mentioned include cell migration (2D and 3D), cell adhesion, and cell invasion. For \"cell migration\", the GO term is \"Cell Migration\" with ID GO:0016477. \"Cell Adhesion\" is GO:0007155. The paper also talks about \"cell invasion\", which might be a bit trickier. I think \"Cell Invasion\" is a child term of cell migration, possibly GO:0033627 (cell invasion in biological contexts). Also, \"cell motility\" is mentioned, which is GO:0048870. \"Cell division\" isn't explicitly mentioned here, but the example included it. Wait, the original description mentions cell shape changes, motility, adhesion, and invasion. So maybe \"Cell Motility\" is appropriate here. The model also uses \"cellular Potts model\", but I'm not sure if that's a GO term. Probably not, so stick with the processes described.\n\nFor MeSH terms, topics like \"Cell Movement\" (D002465), \"Cell Adhesion\" (D002448), and \"Neoplasm Invasiveness\" (D009361) might be relevant. The paper is about EMT, which is a process involved in cancer metastasis, so \"Neoplasm Invasiveness\" fits. \"Collagen\" (D003093) is mentioned as part of the 3D gel environment, so that's a MeSH term. \"Models, Biological\" (D008957) could be another MeSH term since they use a cellular Potts model, which is a type of biological model.\n\nWait, the example included \"Cell Proliferation\" under MeSH, but the original text doesn't mention proliferation. Instead, it's about migration and invasion. So I should avoid adding terms not mentioned. Let me double-check each term.\n\nCellOntology:\n- Epithelial (CL:0000066)\n- Mesenchymal (CL:0008019)\n\nGeneOntology:\n- Cell Migration (GO:0016477)\n- Cell Adhesion (GO:0007155)\n- Cell Invasion (GO:0033627) \u2013 is this correct? Alternatively, \"Cell Motility\" (GO:0048870) is mentioned in the context of 2D migration. The model investigates cell shape changes, motility, and adhesion. So maybe include both Cell Migration and Cell Motility. Wait, \"Cell Motility\" is a broader term, and \"Cell Migration\" is a child term. The paper specifically mentions migration and invasion, so perhaps both GO terms are applicable. The 3D invasion is a form of cell invasion. So include Cell Migration, Cell Adhesion, and Cell Invasion.\n\nMeSH:\n- Cell Movement (D002465)\n- Cell Adhesion (D002448)\n- Neoplasm Invasiveness (D009361) \u2013 but the paper is about EMT in vitro, not necessarily neoplasms. However, MeSH might use this term for invasion processes even in non-cancer contexts. Alternatively, \"Extracellular Matrix\" (D005109) could be relevant because of the collagen gel. Collagen is part of the extracellular matrix. The 3D invasion into collagen gel suggests \"Collagen\" (D003093) and \"Extracellular Matrix\" might be appropriate. Also, \"Models, Biological\" (D008957) as they use a cellular Potts model.\n\nWait, the original description says \"3D invasion into a collagen gel\" so Collagen is definitely a MeSH term. Also, the model is a cellular Potts model, which is a computational model, so \"Models, Biological\" applies. So MeSH terms would be Cell Movement, Cell Adhesion, Collagen, Models, Biological, and maybe Neoplasm Invasiveness if that's the correct term for invasion even without cancer context. Alternatively, check if \"Cell Invasion\" is a MeSH term. Let me verify. MeSH term for Cell Invasion is \"Neoplasm Invasiveness\" (D009361), which is under neoplasms. If the paper's context is general EMT, maybe \"Cell Invasion\" isn't a MeSH term. Alternatively, \"Extracellular Matrix\" (D005109) is relevant because the 3D environment is a collagen gel, which is part of the ECM. So include Collagen and Extracellular Matrix.\n\nSo compiling all:\n\nCellOntology:\n- Epithelial (CL:0000066)\n- Mesenchymal (CL:0008019)\n\nGeneOntology:\n- Cell Migration (GO:0016477)\n- Cell Adhesion (GO:0007155)\n- Cell Motility (GO:0048870) \u2013 since motility is mentioned in the context of 2D migration\n- Cell Invasion (GO:0033627) \u2013 for 3D invasion\n\nMeSH:\n- Cell Movement (D002465)\n- Cell Adhesion (D002448)\n- Collagen (D003093)\n- Extracellular Matrix (D005109)\n- Models, Biological (D008957)\n\nWait, but the original example had \"Cell Proliferation\" under MeSH, which isn't mentioned here. But the user says to follow the original description. So stick to the terms from the description.\n\nDouble-checking the IDs:\n\nCellOntology:\nEpithelial cell is CL:0000066 (exact term is \"epithelial cell\"), but the example uses \"Epithelial\" as the term. Wait, the user says term names must be exact. In the original example, \"Epithelial\" is used. But in Cell Ontology, the term is \"epithelial cell\". However, maybe the user expects the term as per the paper's mention. The paper says \"Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition\", so the terms might be \"Epithelial\" and \"Mesenchymal\". However, in Cell Ontology, the terms are \"epithelial cell\" and \"mesenchymal cell\". So there's a discrepancy. The user's example uses \"Epithelial\" as the term, but in reality, the correct CL term is \"epithelial cell\". But since the user's example shows \"Epithelial\" without \"cell\", maybe they expect that. Wait, looking back at the user's example:\n\nIn the example, they have \"Epithelial\" as the term under CellOntology. But in reality, the CL term for epithelial cells is \"epithelial cell\". However, perhaps the user simplified it. But the user says \"Term names must be exact without extra spaces\". So we need to check the exact term names.\n\nLooking up CL:0000066, the term is \"epithelial cell\". So the exact term is \"epithelial cell\", not \"Epithelial\". Similarly, CL:0008019 is \"mesenchymal cell\".\n\nBut in the user's example, they have \"Epithelial\" as the term. That might be a mistake, but the user's instructions say to follow the example. However, the user also says \"Term names must be exact without extra spaces\". So perhaps in this case, even though the example uses \"Epithelial\", the correct term is \"epithelial cell\". But the original description uses \"Epithelial\" in the context of EMT, which refers to the transition from epithelial to mesenchymal cells. So maybe the correct CL terms are \"epithelial cell\" and \"mesenchymal cell\". However, the user's example uses \"Epithelial\" as the term. Hmm. This is a conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects us to use the terms as they appear in the paper, even if they're not the exact ontology terms. But that would be incorrect. The correct approach is to use the exact ontology term names.\n\nBut given the example provided by the user, they have \"Epithelial\" under CellOntology with ID \"CL:0000000\". So perhaps the user is using abbreviated terms. However, to comply with the user's instruction, we must use exact term names. So if the correct term is \"epithelial cell\", that's what should be used.\n\nBut the problem is that the user's example uses \"Epithelial\" as the term. This is conflicting. However, the user says to format term names exactly as specified, which in their example is \"Epithelial\" and \"Mesenchymal\". But in reality, the correct terms would include \"cell\". However, since the user's example does that, perhaps we should follow that pattern, even if it's technically incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in their example. But since we have to follow their instructions, we might proceed with the terms as they appear in the paper, but check the actual ontology terms.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Epithelial\" is a valid CL term. Let me check the Cell Ontology.\n\nLooking up CL:0000066, the label is \"epithelial cell\". There's also a term \"epithelial cell of trachea\" or other specific types, but the general term is \"epithelial cell\". Similarly, \"mesenchymal cell\" is CL:0008019. There's no CL term just \"Epithelial\" or \"Mesenchymal\". So the correct terms would be \"ep"
