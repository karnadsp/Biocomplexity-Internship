      "response": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem. The user wants structured ontology annotations based on the provided paper description. The main ontologies to consider are Cell Ontology (CL), Gene Ontology (GO), and MeSH.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original description. The paper discusses Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) in vitro simulations using a cellular Potts model. Conditions include 2D migration on a surface and 3D invasion into collagen gel. Key points are loss of endocardial adhesion for 2D migration and loss of cohesion plus gain in adhesion to collagen for 3D invasion. Also mentioned are cell shape changes, motility, and adhesion in the 2D model.\n\nFor CellOntology, the terms \"Epithelial\" and \"Mesenchymal\" are obvious. Their CL IDs should be correct. Let me check: Epithelial cell is CL:0000066, Mesenchymal cell is CL:0008020. Wait, I need to confirm. CL:0000066 is indeed epithelial cell. Mesenchymal cell is CL:0008020. Got it.\n\nGeneOntology terms: The processes mentioned include cell migration (GO:0016477 for cell migration), cell adhesion (GO:0007155 for cell adhesion), and maybe cell motility (which might be part of migration). Also, collagen adhesion is part of cell adhesion. The 3D invasion might involve extracellular matrix organization (GO:0030198). The model uses cellular Potts model, which is a computational model, so maybe computational simulation (GO:0034300). Let me check GO terms. Cell migration is GO:0016477. Cell adhesion is GO:0007155. Extracellular matrix organization is GO:0030198. For computational simulation, GO:0034300 is biological process simulation. Yes.\n\nMeSH terms: EMT is MeSH D057885. Collagen is D003093. Cell adhesion is D015815. Cell movement is D002465. Models, Biological would be D008954. Cellular Potts model is a type of computational model, but MeSH might not have a specific term for it. So perhaps include \"Models, Biological\" (D008954). Invasion is part of cell movement. So EMT (D057885), Collagen (D003093), Cell Adhesion (D015815), Cell Movement (D002465), Models, Biological (D008954).\n\nNow, structure the JSON exactly as specified. Check for exact category names, IDs without spaces, and term names correctly spelled. No extra spaces in terms. Let me double-check each ID and term:\n\nCellOntology entries:\n- CL:0000066 Epithelial cell (term should be \"Epithelial\"? Wait, the term name in the example was \"Epithelial\" but the actual CL term is \"epithelial cell\". The user said term names must be exact. So if the paper mentions Epithelial, maybe the term is \"Epithelial cell\". But the example used \"Epithelial\" as term. Wait, the user's example shows \"Epithelial\" under CellOntology. But in reality, the CL term is \"epithelial cell\". However, maybe the user wants the term as it appears in the text. The original description says \"Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition\", so maybe the terms are \"Epithelial\" and \"Mesenchymal\". But in Cell Ontology, the terms are \"epithelial cell\" and \"mesenchymal cell\". This could be a conflict. However, the user specified to use term names exactly as specified, but without extra spaces. The example shows \"Epithelial\" without \"cell\". Wait, the example in the user message has \"Epithelial\" as the term, but in reality, the CL term would include \"cell\". But the user's instruction says term names must be exact without extra spaces. So maybe the user expects the term to be \"Epithelial\" even if the actual ontology term is \"epithelial cell\". But that would be incorrect. Wait, the user's example uses \"Epithelial\" with id CL:0000000 (which is a fake example). So perhaps in the actual case, we should use the correct term names as per the ontology. Let me confirm: Epithelial cell is CL:0000066, term name \"epithelial cell\". Mesenchymal cell is CL:0008020, term \"mesenchymal cell\". However, the original text refers to Epithelial and Mesenchymal (the transition). So maybe the terms are just \"Epithelial\" and \"Mesenchymal\" in the ontology? No, that's not correct. The actual Cell Ontology terms include \"cell\". Therefore, should the term be \"epithelial cell\" or \"Epithelial\"? The user's example shows \"Epithelial\" as the term. This is conflicting. But the user might want the terms as mentioned in the text, not the exact ontology term. However, the instructions say \"Term names must be exact without extra spaces\". So perhaps the exact term from the ontology. Wait, the example in the user's message uses \"Epithelial\" as the term, but that's not the actual term. So maybe the user is okay with simplified terms. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. To comply with the user's example, perhaps use \"Epithelial\" and \"Mesenchymal\" even if the actual terms are longer. But that's not accurate. Alternatively, maybe the user expects the correct ontology terms. I need to make a decision. Since the user emphasized exact term names, but the example shows \"Epithelial\", maybe the user expects the terms as they appear in the text. However, that's not how ontologies work. But given the example, perhaps the answer should use the terms as \"Epithelial\" and \"Mesenchymal\". But in reality, the correct terms are \"epithelial cell\" and \"mesenchymal cell\". But the user's example has \"Epithelial\" with CL id. Wait, the example in the user message is fake. The actual CL IDs for epithelial and mesenchymal cells would be different. So perhaps the correct approach is to look up the actual CL terms. Let me check:\n\nEpithelial cell: CL:0000066, term name \"epithelial cell\"\nMesenchymal cell: CL:0008020, term name \"mesenchymal cell\"\n\nSo in the JSON, the terms should be \"epithelial cell\" and \"mesenchymal cell\". But the original text uses \"Epithelial\" and \"Mesenchymal\". However, the user's instructions say \"Term names must be exact without extra spaces\". So probably, the exact ontology terms. Therefore, the terms would be \"epithelial cell\" and \"mesenchymal cell\". But the example shows \"Epithelial\" as term. This is conflicting. The user's example might be simplified. But since the user provided an example with \"Epithelial\" as term, maybe they expect that, even if it's not the exact ontology term. Alternatively, the user might have made a mistake in the example. To resolve this, perhaps check if there are CL terms for EMT or the transition itself. But EMT is a process, so likely not in Cell Ontology. The Cell Ontology terms would be the cell types involved. Therefore, \"epithelial cell\" and \"mesenchymal cell\" are the correct terms. But the user's example shows \"Epithelial\" as term. Hmm. This is a problem. The user's instructions are conflicting here. But according to the problem statement, the user wants ontology annotations, so the correct terms from the ontologies. Therefore, I should use the exact terms from the ontologies. So \"epithelial cell\" and \"mesenchymal cell\" with their correct CL IDs.\n\nBut wait, the original text refers to Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), which is a process where epithelial cells transition to mesenchymal cells. So the Cell Ontology terms would be the cell types, hence \"epithelial cell\" and \"mesenchymal cell\". Therefore, the correct terms with their CL IDs are CL:0000066 and CL:0008020. However, the user's example uses \"Epithelial\" as term. But I think following the ontology's exact term is more important here. So I'll proceed with the correct terms.\n\nNext, GeneOntology terms. Processes mentioned: cell migration (GO:0016477), cell adhesion (GO:0007155), extracellular matrix organization (GO:0030198), biological process simulation (GO:0034300). The model uses a cellular Potts model, which is a computational simulation method. So GO:0034300 is \"biological process simulation\". Also, cell motility (which is part of migration). Maybe cell motility is GO:0048870, but cell migration is already covered. The paper talks about adhesion, so cell adhesion (GO:0007155) and cell-matrix adhesion (GO:0007160). Also, loss of cohesion might refer to cell-cell adhesion (GO:0098602). But perhaps stick to the broader terms mentioned. The model demonstrates conditions for migration and invasion. So cell migration, cell adhesion, extracellular matrix organization, and simulation.\n\nMeSH terms: EMT is MeSH D057885. Collagen is D003093. Cell adhesion is D015815. Cell movement is D002465. Models, Biological is D008954. Invasion might be covered under cell movement. The cellular Potts model is a computational model, so \"Models, Biological\" (D008954) and possibly \"Computer Simulation\" (D003198). But MeSH terms: Computer Simulation is D003198. So include that as well.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nCellOntology:\n- CL:0000066 epithelial cell\n- CL:0008020 mesenchymal cell"
