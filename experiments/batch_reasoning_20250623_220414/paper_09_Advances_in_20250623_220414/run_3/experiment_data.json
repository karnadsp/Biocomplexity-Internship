The 3D model captures the hierarchy effective surface tensions that correspond to the three experimental conditions of stable monolayer, 2D migration, and 3D invasion.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to create a JSON object with ontology annotations based on the provided paper description. The categories are CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH, each with their specific IDs and terms.\n\nFirst, looking at the CellOntology. The paper talks about Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), so I need terms related to epithelial and mesenchymal cells. Checking Cell Ontology, \"Epithelial Cell\" is CL:0000066 and \"Mesenchymal Cell\" is CL:0008019. Got those IDs.\n\nNext, GeneOntology. The model involves cell adhesion, migration, and invasion. The processes mentioned are cell migration (GO:0016477), cell adhesion (GO:0007155), and biological adhesion (GO:0022610). Also, cell-cell adhesion (GO:0098609) and cell-matrix adhesion (GO:0007160) are relevant here. The molecular functions include cell adhesion molecule binding (GO:0050839). Cellular components might include collagen-containing extracellular matrix (GO:0062023). Need to verify these terms and IDs to make sure they're exact.\n\nFor MeSH terms, the paper discusses Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (D058750), Cell Movement (D002465), Cell Adhesion (D015815), Collagen (D003093), and Extracellular Matrix (D005109). Check each MeSH ID to ensure correctness.\n\nNow, structure the JSON exactly as per the example. Ensure category names are correct, IDs have no spaces, and terms are properly capitalized. Let me double-check each term and ID against the respective ontologies to avoid mistakes. Once confirmed, assemble the JSON without any extra text.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000066\",\n            \"term\": \"Epithelial Cell\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0008019\",\n            \"term\": \"Mesenchymal Cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0016477\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Migration\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007155\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0022610\",\n            \"term\": \"Biological Adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0098609\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell-Cell Adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007160\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell-Matrix Adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0050839\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Adhesion Molecule Binding\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0062023\",\n            \"term\": \"Collagen-Containing Extracellular Matrix\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D058750\",\n            \"term\": \"Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002465\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Movement\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D015815\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D003093\",\n            \"term\": \"Collagen\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D005109\",\n            \"term\": \"Extracellular Matrix\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"

Add plugins like Volume, Contact, and Chemotaxis. Volume and Contact are necessary for basic cell behavior, and Chemotaxis might relate to migration.\n\nFinally, register the steppable with CompuCellSetup.
