      "response": "<think>\nAlright, let me break this down. The user wants structured ontology annotations based on the given chapter description. The key points mentioned are cell migration's role in physiological processes like wound healing and immune response, as well as pathological processes like chronic inflammation and cancer metastasis. They also mention artificial systems enhancing cell migration and anti-cancer treatments blocking migration.\n\nFirst, for CellOntology, the main cell type involved here is mesenchymal cells because they're known for migration during processes like wound healing and metastasis. So I should use CL:0008019 for Mesenchymal Stem Cells. Epithelial cells are mentioned too, especially with metastasis involving epithelial-mesenchymal transition, but the example uses \"Epithelial\" with CL:0000000. Wait, checking the actual Cell Ontology, CL:0000000 isn't correct. Maybe the example was a placeholder. Let me verify. Mesenchymal stem cells are CL:0008034, but the exact term might vary. Alternatively, \"Mesenchymal Cell\" might have a different ID. But since the example uses CL:0000000 for Epithelial, maybe I should stick to that for consistency, even though it's a placeholder. But actually, real CL IDs for epithelial cells are like CL:0000066 for epithelial cell. Hmm, the user might expect the example's structure even with placeholders. But I need to use accurate IDs. Wait, the user's example had \"Epithelial\" with CL:0000000, but in reality, correct IDs are needed. Let me check:\n\nEpithelial cell is CL:0000066. Mesenchymal cell is CL:0008019 (mesenchymal stem cell). So I should use those IDs.\n\nFor GeneOntology, the main processes are cell migration (GO:0016477), cell motility involved in immune response (GO:0002553), wound healing (GO:0042060), and response to anticancer drug (GO:1904595). Also, tissue invasion might relate to cell invasion (GO:0015269). \n\nMeSH terms would include \"Cell Movement\" (D002465), \"Neoplasm Metastasis\" (D009362), \"Wound Healing\" (D014947), \"Immune System Processes\" (D007107), and maybe \"Antineoplastic Agents\" (D000970) for the treatment aspect.\n\nWait, the original text mentions anti-cancer treatments blocking migration, so MeSH terms could include \"Antineoplastic Agents\" (D000970). \n\nLet me structure this:\n\nCellOntology: Epithelial Cell (CL:0000066) and Mesenchymal Cell (CL:0008019).\n\nGeneOntology: Cell migration (GO:0016477), immune response process (GO:0002553), wound healing (GO:0042060), cell invasion (GO:0015269), response to anticancer drug (GO:1904595).\n\nMeSH: Cell Movement (D002465), Neoplasm Metastasis (D009362), Wound Healing (D014947), Immune System Processes (D007107), Antineoplastic Agents (D000970).\n\nI need to ensure that the terms are exact, no extra spaces. Let me confirm each ID and term:\n\n- CL:0000066: epithelial cell (term name \"Epithelial Cell\"? The example had \"Epithelial\" but the correct term might include \"Cell\". The user's example says \"Epithelial\" but maybe the actual term is \"epithelial cell\". However, the user wants exact term names. Let me check Cell Ontology: the term is \"epithelial cell\" (lowercase?), but the user example capitalizes the first letter. So maybe \"Epithelial Cell\". Wait, in the example, the term was \"Epithelial\". Hmm, perhaps the user wants the term as \"Epithelial\" even if it's not the full term. But according to the Cell Ontology, the exact term for CL:0000066 is \"epithelial cell\". However, the user's example uses \"Epithelial\" with CL:0000000. Since the user might prioritize formatting over accuracy here, but the instructions say to use exact terms. This is a bit conflicting. Maybe the user expects \"Epithelial\" as the term, but with the correct CL ID. Alternatively, perhaps the example was just illustrative. To be safe, use the exact terms from the ontologies.\n\nWait, the user's instructions state: \"Term names must be exact without extra spaces\". So I must use the exact term from the ontology. For CL:0000066, the term is \"epithelial cell\". But in the example, they used \"Epithelial\". However, the user's example might not be accurate. The user says to follow the example's structure but use exact terms. So perhaps in the example, \"Epithelial\" is just a shorthand. But according to the actual ontology, it's \"epithelial cell\". So I need to use the exact term. Same with mesenchymal: CL:0008019 is \"mesenchymal stem cell\". Wait, no, CL:0008019 is \"mesenchymal cell\". Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking up CL:0008019: Yes, \"mesenchymal cell\" is the term. So in that case, the terms would be \"epithelial cell\" and \"mesenchymal cell\". But the user's example used \"Epithelial\" with a capital E. However, ontology terms are usually lowercase except proper nouns. But the example shows \"Epithelial\" with a capital. The user's instructions say term names must be exact. So if the actual term is \"epithelial cell\", then that's what should be used. However, perhaps the example was simplified. This is a bit confusing. Let me proceed with the exact terms as per the ontology.\n\nFor Gene Ontology terms:\n\n- Cell migration: GO:0016477, term \"cell migration\".\n\n- Immune response: maybe GO:0006955 (immune response), but the text mentions immune response processes. The example used \"Cell Division\" with a capital letter, so maybe terms are in title case. Wait, GO terms are usually in lowercase, but the user's example has \"Cell Division\" which is title case. So perhaps the user expects title case regardless of actual ontology formatting. But the instructions say term names must be exact. So need to check exact term names.\n\nLooking up GO:0016477: term is \"cell migration\" (lowercase). GO:0002553 is \"motility involved in immune response\". GO:0042060 is \"wound healing\". GO:1904595 is \"response to anticancer drug\". GO:0015269 is \"cell invasion\".\n\nFor MeSH terms:\n\n- Cell Movement: D002465, term \"Cell Movement\".\n\n- Neoplasm Metastasis: D009362.\n\n- Wound Healing: D014947.\n\n- Immune System Processes: D007107, term \"Immune System Phenomena\" perhaps? Wait, MeSH term for immune response might be \"Immune System Processes\" (D007107). Let me confirm. Checking MeSH, \"Immune System Processes\" is D007107. \"Antineoplastic Agents\" is D000970.\n\nPutting it all together, ensuring IDs and terms are exact as per the ontologies. Now, the user's example used title case for terms, but actual terms might be lowercase. However, the user's instruction says term names must be exact, so I should use the exact case as in the ontology. For example, \"cell migration\" (lowercase) for GO:0016477. But the example in the user's message has \"Cell Division\" (title case). This discrepancy is a problem. The user might have conflicting instructions. Since the example uses title case, but the actual terms are lowercase, this is a dilemma. The user says to follow term names exactly, so I should use the exact term from the ontology, even if lowercase. However, the example in the user's message uses title case. But perhaps the example was just illustrative and not accurate. The user's instructions take precedence: \"Term names must be exact without extra spaces\". Therefore, I must use the exact term as per the ontology, even if lowercase.\n\nBut let me check the actual terms:\n\n- GO:0016477: term name \"cell migration\".\n\n- GO:0002553: \"motility involved in immune response\".\n\n- GO:0042060: \"wound healing\".\n\n- GO:1904595: \"response to anticancer drug\".\n\n- GO:0015269: \"cell invasion\".\n\nMeSH terms:\n\n- D002465: \"Cell Movement\".\n\n- D009362: \"Neoplasm Metastasis\".\n\n- D014947: \"Wound Healing\".\n\n- D007107: \"Immune System Processes\".\n\n- D000970: \"Antineoplastic Agents\".\n\nSo for MeSH terms, they are in title case. For GO terms, lowercase. Cell Ontology terms are lowercase. But the user's example has \"Epithelial\" in title case. This inconsistency is a problem. The user's instructions say term names must be exact, so I should use the exact case as in the ontology. Therefore:\n\nCellOntology entries would be \"epithelial cell\" (CL:0000066) and \"mesenchymal cell\" (CL:0008019).\n\nGeneOntology entries would be lowercase terms.\n\nMeSH entries would be title case.\n\nBut the user's example shows \"Epithelial\" and \"Cell Division\" in title case. This suggests that the user expects title case regardless. But the instructions say to use exact term names. This is conflicting. The user might have made a mistake in the example. To adhere strictly to the instructions, I should use the exact term names as"
