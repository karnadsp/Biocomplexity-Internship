ORIGINAL BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This chapter will explain what kind of support mathematics can give to biology and medicine. In order to explain the concepts in practice cell migration is used as a specific example. This phenomenon is of great biomedical interest because it is a fundamental phenomenon both in physiological (e.g. wound healing, immune response) and pathological processes (e.g. chronic inflammation, detachment of metastasis and related tissue invasion). Also a key feature of any artificial system aimed atmimicking biological structures is to allow and enhance cellmigration on or inside it. At the same time anti-cancer treatment can become more efficient blocking cellâ€™s capability to migrate towards distant sites and invade different organs.
