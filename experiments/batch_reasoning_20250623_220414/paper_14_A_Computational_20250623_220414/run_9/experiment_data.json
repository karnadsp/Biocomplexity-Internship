        "description": "Vascular development is a complex process regulated by dynamic biological networks that vary in topology and state across different tissues and developmental stages. Signals regulating de novo blood vessel formation (vasculogenesis) and remodeling (angiogenesis) come from a variety of biological pathways linked to endothelial cell (EC) behavior, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and the local generation of chemokines and growth factors. Simulating these interactions at a systems level requires sufficient biological detail about the relevant molecular pathways and associated cellular behaviors, and tractable computational models that offset mathematical and biological complexity. Here, we describe a novel multicellular agent-based model of vasculogenesis using the CompuCell3D (http://www.compucell3d.org/) modeling environment supplemented with semi-automatic knowledgebase creation. The model incorporates vascular endothelial growth factor signals, pro- and anti-angiogenic inflammatory chemokine signals, and the plasminogen activating system of enzymes and proteases linked to ECM interactions, to simulate nascent EC organization, growth and remodeling. The model was shown to recapitulate stereotypical capillary plexus formation and structural emergence of non-coded cellular behaviors, such as a heterologous bridging phenomenon linking endothelial tip cells together during formation of polygonal endothelial cords. Molecular targets in the computational model were mapped to signatures of vascular disruption derived from in vitro chemical profiling using the EPA's ToxCast high-throughput screening (HTS) dataset. Simulating the HTS data with the cell-agent based model of vascular development predicted adverse effects of a reference anti-angiogenic thalidomide analog, 5HPP-33, on in vitro angiogenesis with respect to both concentration-response and morphological consequences. These findings support the utility of cell agent-based models for simulating a morphogenetic series of events and for the first time demonstrate the applicability of these models for predictive toxicology."

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a JSON object with ontology annotations for the provided description on vascular development. Let me start by parsing the original text to identify relevant terms for each ontology category: CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH.\n\nFirst, CellOntology. The text mentions endothelial cells (EC) and endothelial tip cells. Checking the Cell Ontology, the term for endothelial cell is CL:0000115. Endothelial tip cells might be CL:0002138. Also, there's mention of extracellular matrix (ECM), but that's more of a structure than a cell type, so probably not CellOntology.\n\nNext, GeneOntology. The processes involved include vasculogenesis (GO:0001570), angiogenesis (GO:0001525), cell proliferation (GO:0008283), extracellular matrix organization (GO:0030198), and possibly plasminogen activation (GO:0031639). The text talks about VEGF signals, which is part of the VEGF-activated receptor signaling pathway (GO:0038084). Also, ECM remodeling and proteases are mentioned, so maybe extracellular matrix disassembly (GO:0022617). Cell division might be relevant too (GO:0051301), but the example uses Cell Division, which is GO:0051301.\n\nFor MeSH terms, the relevant ones would be Endothelial Cells (D004727), Extracellular Matrix (D005109), Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (D018149), Chemokines (D018149 might be a stretch, but Chemokines in general are D018149? Wait, no. Checking MeSH: Chemokines are under D018149. Plasminogen is D010957. Angiogenesis (D000096). Vasculogenesis (D034883). High-Throughput Screening (D058030). Toxicogenetics might be under D000077242, but the text mentions predictive toxicology, so perhaps \"Toxicology\" as D014352. Also, Thalidomide analogs like 5HPP-33, but MeSH would have Thalidomide (D013792). Adverse effects might be D008297. Morphogenesis (D009028).\n\nWait, need to verify MeSH IDs. Let me check:\n\n- Endothelial Cells: MeSH D004727\n- Extracellular Matrix: D005109\n- Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor: D018149 (VEGFs are D018149)\n- Chemokines: D018149 is VEGF, so Chemokines might be D002395 (Chemokines) but the exact term is \"Chemokines\". Check: Yes, Chemokines are D002395.\n- Plasminogen: D010957\n- Angiogenesis: D000096\n- Vasculogenesis: D034883\n- High-Throughput Screening: D058030\n- Toxicology: D014352\n- Thalidomide: D013792\n- Morphogenesis: D009028\n- Adverse Drug Reaction: D004318 (but the text mentions adverse effects of the compound, so maybe D004318)\n- Predictive Toxicology: Not sure, but maybe D014352 (Toxicology) is sufficient.\n\nNow, compiling these into the JSON structure as per the example. Need to make sure the category names are exact, IDs without spaces, terms exact without extra spaces.\n\nFor CellOntology: Endothelial Cell (CL:0000115), Endothelial Tip Cell (CL:0002138).\n\nGeneOntology: Vasculogenesis (GO:0001570), Angiogenesis (GO:0001525), Cell Proliferation (GO:0008283), Extracellular Matrix Organization (GO:0030198), Plasminogen Activation (GO:0031639), VEGF-activated receptor signaling (GO:0038084), Extracellular Matrix Disassembly (GO:0022617), Cell Division (GO:0051301).\n\nMeSH: Endothelial Cells (D004727), Extracellular Matrix (D005109), Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (D018149), Chemokines (D002395), Plasminogen (D010957), Angiogenesis (D000096), Vasculogenesis (D034883), High-Throughput Screening (D058030), Toxicology (D014352), Thalidomide (D013792), Morphogenesis (D009028), Adverse effects (D004318? Or maybe Adverse Drug Reaction is D004318, but the term in the text is \"adverse effects\", which might map to D000068882 \"Adverse Outcome Pathways\", but perhaps safer to include D004318 if that's the closest. Alternatively, the term \"Adverse effects\" could be under D064420 \"Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions\". But maybe the user wants general terms. Since the example uses \"Cell Proliferation\" for MeSH, maybe stick to broader terms. Alternatively, check if \"Adverse effects\" is a MeSH term. Searching MeSH, \"Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems\" is D000068381, but the term \"Adverse effects\" is not exact. Maybe omit this and focus on terms explicitly mentioned. The text mentions \"predictive toxicology\", which is covered by Toxicology (D014352).\n\nSo compiling:\n\nCellOntology: Endothelial Cell and Endothelial Tip Cell.\n\nGeneOntology: Vasculogenesis, Angiogenesis, Cell Proliferation, Extracellular Matrix Organization, Plasminogen Activation, VEGF-activated receptor signaling, Extracellular Matrix Disassembly, Cell Division.\n\nMeSH: Endothelial Cells, Extracellular Matrix, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor, Chemokines, Plasminogen, Angiogenesis, Vasculogenesis, High-Throughput Screening, Toxicology, Thalidomide, Morphogenesis.\n\nNow, check the exact term names and IDs. For example, VEGF-activated receptor signaling pathway is GO:0038084, and the term name is \"vascular endothelial growth factor-activated receptor signaling pathway\". But the user says term names must be exact. So as per GO, the term is \"vascular endothelial growth factor-activated receptor signaling pathway\", but the example uses \"Cell Division\" as the term. So I need to use the exact term from the ontology.\n\nWait, in GO, the term for GO:0038084 is \"vascular endothelial growth factor-activated receptor signaling pathway\". So in the JSON, the term should be exactly that. However, the example in the problem statement uses \"Cell Division\" for GO:0000000. But in the original text, the user might have abbreviated. However, the instructions say term names must be exact. So I need to use the exact term as in the ontology.\n\nSimilarly for MeSH terms. For example, \"Thalidomide\" is D013792, and the term is \"Thalidomide\".\n\nBut let me verify each term's exact name:\n\nCellOntology:\n\n- CL:0000115: \"endothelial cell\" (but the term is \"endothelial cell\", but in the example, the term was \"Epithelial\" with capital E. So should we capitalize? The example has \"Epithelial\" and \"Mesenchymal\" which are capitalized. So perhaps the terms are in title case. Checking Cell Ontology entry for CL:0000115: the label is \"endothelial cell\". But the example in the problem uses \"Epithelial\" with capital E. So maybe the user expects the term to be in the exact case as per the ontology. However, some ontologies use title case. For example, CL ontology entries are in lowercase except proper nouns. Wait, checking the CL entry for CL:0000115: the label is \"endothelial cell\". So the correct term is \"endothelial cell\" in lowercase. However, in the example given, the term is \"Epithelial\" (capitalized). This is conflicting. Wait, in the example, the user wrote \"Epithelial\" but in CL, the term is \"epithelial cell\". Hmm, maybe the example is simplified. But the user instructions say \"Term names must be exact without extra spaces\". Therefore, I should use the exact term as per the ontology, including case and wording.\n\nTherefore, for CL:0000115, the term is \"endothelial cell\". For CL:0002138, it's \"endothelial tip cell\".\n\nGeneOntology terms:\n\n- Vasculogenesis: GO:0001570 term is \"vasculogenesis\".\n- Angiogenesis: GO:0001525 term is \"angiogenesis\".\n- Cell Proliferation: GO:0008283 term is \"cell proliferation\".\n- Extracellular Matrix Organization: GO:0030198 term is \"extracellular matrix organization\".\n- Plasminogen Activation: GO:0031639 term is \"plasminogen activation\".\n- VEGF-activated receptor signaling pathway: GO:0038084 term is \"vascular endothelial growth factor-activated receptor signaling pathway\".\n- Extracellular Matrix Disassembly: GO:0022617 term is \"extracellular matrix disassembly\".\n- Cell Division: GO:0051301 term is \"cell division\".\n\nMeSH terms:\n\n- Endothelial Cells: D004727 term is \"Endothelial Cells\".\n- Extracellular Matrix: D005109 term is \"Extracellular Matrix\".\n- Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor: D018149 term is \"Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A\" (Wait, checking MeSH: D018149 is \"Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A\". But there's a broader term \"Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors\" (D018149). Wait, no, MeSH entry for D018149 is \"Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A\". The general term for Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors is D018149. Wait, maybe there's a more general term. Alternatively, perhaps the"
