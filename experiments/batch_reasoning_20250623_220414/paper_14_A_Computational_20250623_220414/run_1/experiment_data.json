        "description": "Vascular development is a complex process regulated by dynamic biological networks that vary in topology and state across different tissues and developmental stages. Signals regulating de novo blood vessel formation (vasculogenesis) and remodeling (angiogenesis) come from a variety of biological pathways linked to endothelial cell (EC) behavior, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and the local generation of chemokines and growth factors. Simulating these interactions at a systems level requires sufficient biological detail about the relevant molecular pathways and associated cellular behaviors, and tractable computational models that offset mathematical and biological complexity. Here, we describe a novel multicellular agent-based model of vasculogenesis using the CompuCell3D (http://www.compucell3d.org/) modeling environment supplemented with semi-automatic knowledgebase creation. The model incorporates vascular endothelial growth factor signals, pro- and anti-angiogenic inflammatory chemokine signals, and the plasminogen activating system of enzymes and proteases linked to ECM interactions, to simulate nascent EC organization, growth and remodeling. The model was shown to recapitulate stereotypical capillary plexus formation and structural emergence of non-coded cellular behaviors, such as a heterologous bridging phenomenon linking endothelial tip cells together during formation of polygonal endothelial cords. Molecular targets in the computational model were mapped to signatures of vascular disruption derived from in vitro chemical profiling using the EPA's ToxCast high-throughput screening (HTS) dataset. Simulating the HTS data with the cell-agent based model of vascular development predicted adverse effects of a reference anti-angiogenic thalidomide analog, 5HPP-33, on in vitro angiogenesis with respect to both concentration-response and morphological consequences. These findings support the utility of cell agent-based models for simulating a morphogenetic series of events and for the first time demonstrate the applicability of these models for predictive toxicology."

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a JSON object with ontology annotations based on the provided information. Let me start by carefully reading the original description and the user's requirements.\n\nFirst, the user wants three categories: CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH. The IDs and terms must be exact. Let me parse the text for relevant terms.\n\nThe original text mentions endothelial cells (ECs). CellOntology should include ECs. Checking the Cell Ontology, the term for endothelial cell is CL:0000115. So that's one entry for CellOntology.\n\nNext, GeneOntology terms. The processes discussed include vasculogenesis (blood vessel formation) and angiogenesis (remodeling). Also mentioned are extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and cell proliferation. Looking up GO terms: Vasculogenesis is GO:0001570, Angiogenesis is GO:0001525, ECM remodeling is GO:0030198, and cell proliferation is GO:0008283. Those should be included under GeneOntology.\n\nFor MeSH terms, the text talks about vascular development, which is MeSH D014652. It also mentions the plasminogen activator system, which is part of the fibrinolytic system. MeSH has \"Fibrinolysis\" as D005361. Additionally, there's reference to predictive toxicology, which is MeSH D059587. ToxCast is part of the EPA's high-throughput screening, so predictive toxicology fits here.\n\nI need to ensure all IDs are correctly formatted without spaces. Term names must match exactly. Let me double-check each term and ID:\n\n- Endothelial cell: CL:0000115 is correct.\n- Vasculogenesis: GO:0001570. Yes.\n- Angiogenesis: GO:0001525. Correct.\n- Extracellular matrix remodeling: GO:0030198. Right.\n- Cell proliferation: GO:0008283. Yes.\n- Vascular Development (MeSH D014652). Check.\n- Fibrinolysis: D005361. Correct.\n- Predictive toxicology: D059587. Yes.\n\nI should list each under their respective categories. Now, structure the JSON as specified. No extra fields or explanations. Make sure category names are exact: CellOntology, GeneOntology, MeSH. All IDs without spaces. Terms exactly as per the ontologies.\n\nWait, the MeSH term for vascular development is \"Vascular Development\" but the MeSH term might have a different exact name. Let me verify. MeSH D014652 is \"Vascular Remodeling\" but the text says \"vascular development\". Hmm. Wait, maybe \"Vascular Development\" is a separate term. Alternatively, MeSH might have \"Blood Vessels\" or \"Angiogenesis\". Wait, checking MeSH terms, D014652 is actually \"Neovascularization, Physiologic\", which includes angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. But the user might expect \"Vascular Development\". Alternatively, perhaps the exact term is \"Blood Vessels\" under MeSH D001808. Wait, no. Let me check again. Alternatively, \"Vascular Development\" might not be a MeSH term. Maybe I should use \"Angiogenesis\" as a MeSH term. MeSH D017147 is \"Neovascularization, Pathologic\", but D014652 is \"Neovascularization, Physiologic\". The original text refers to both vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. Since MeSH terms might not have a direct \"Vascular Development\", perhaps the best fit is \"Neovascularization, Physiologic\" (D014652). But the user example uses \"Cell Proliferation\" which is a MeSH term. Alternatively, perhaps the MeSH term for \"Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors\" is D018149. But the text mentions \"vascular development\" as a general process. Let me confirm: Searching MeSH for \"vascular development\" gives \"Vascular Remodeling\" (D058729), but that's a different ID. Alternatively, \"Blood Vessels\" (D001808). Hmm. Maybe \"Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor\" as a MeSH term. The text also mentions the plasminogen activating system linked to ECM. Fibrinolysis is D005361. For predictive toxicology, D059587 is correct. The original text also mentions ToxCast, which relates to toxicology. So perhaps MeSH entries should be \"Fibrinolysis\" (D005361), \"Predictive Toxicology\" (D059587), and \"Neovascularization, Physiologic\" (D014652). Alternatively, \"Angiogenesis\" is D018149 for the VEGF term. Wait, D018149 is \"Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A\". The MeSH term for angiogenesis itself is D000096224, but that's a new term. Alternatively, maybe use \"Angiogenesis Inducing Agents\" (D017122). This is getting tricky. To avoid errors, perhaps stick with the terms that are definitely mentioned: Fibrinolysis (plasminogen system), Predictive Toxicology, and Vascular Development. If D014652 is \"Neovascularization, Physiologic\", which includes both vasculogenesis and angiogenesis, that's a good fit. So MeSH terms would be:\n\n- D014652: Neovascularization, Physiologic\n- D005361: Fibrinolysis\n- D059587: Predictive Toxicology\n\nBut the user might expect the term \"Vascular Development\", but if that's not a MeSH term, then \"Neovascularization, Physiologic\" is better. Alternatively, maybe \"Blood Vessels\" (D001808) is more general. The user's example uses \"Cell Proliferation\" as a MeSH term, which is correct (D002467). So perhaps the correct MeSH terms here are:\n\n1. \"Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors\" (D018149) since VEGF is mentioned.\n2. \"Fibrinolysis\" (D005361) for the plasminogen system.\n3. \"Predictive Toxicology\" (D059587).\n4. \"Angiogenesis\" (if applicable, but MeSH uses \"Neovascularization, Physiologic\").\n\nBut the original text mentions \"vascular development\", \"vasculogenesis\", \"angiogenesis\", \"ECM remodeling\", \"plasminogen activating system\", \"predictive toxicology\". For MeSH, the relevant terms might be:\n\n- \"Angiogenesis\" (if available as a term)\n- \"Fibrinolysis\" (plasminogen system)\n- \"Predictive Toxicology\"\n\nChecking MeSH again:\n\n- \"Angiogenesis\" is mapped to \"Neovascularization, Physiologic\" (D014652)\n- \"Fibrinolysis\" is D005361\n- \"Predictive Toxicology\" is D059587\n- \"Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A\" is D018149\n\nSince the text specifically mentions VEGF signals, including that as a MeSH term might be appropriate. So MeSH entries could be:\n\n1. \"Neovascularization, Physiologic\" (D014652)\n2. \"Fibrinolysis\" (D005361)\n3. \"Predictive Toxicology\" (D059587)\n4. \"Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A\" (D018149)\n\nBut the user example has three entries. Maybe prioritize the ones most relevant. The text emphasizes VEGF signals, so D018149 is important. Fibrinolysis is part of the plasminogen system mentioned. Predictive toxicology is the application. Neovascularization covers angiogenesis and vasculogenesis.\n\nSo the MeSH array would include:\n\n- D014652: Neovascularization, Physiologic\n- D005361: Fibrinolysis\n- D018149: Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A\n- D059587: Predictive Toxicology\n\nBut maybe the user expects three entries. However, the example has three, but the user didn't specify a limit. Let me check the original text. The user says \"Include relevant ... MeSH terms where applicable.\" So include all relevant.\n\nWait, the original example had three, but the user says \"where applicable\". So including all four may be okay, but I need to verify.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor\" is part of the Gene Ontology? No, VEGF is a protein, so maybe not in GO. The GO terms are for processes. So MeSH terms for VEGF would be appropriate.\n\nSo the final MeSH entries:\n\n[\n  {\n    \"id\": \"D014652\",\n    \"term\": \"Neovascularization, Physiologic\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"D005361\",\n    \"term\": \"Fibrinolysis\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"D018149\",\n    \"term\": \"Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"D059587\",\n    \"term\": \"Predictive Toxicology\"\n  }\n]\n\nBut I need to check if \"Neovascularization, Physiologic\" is the exact term. Yes, according to MeSH. Also, \"Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A\" is the correct term for VEGF-A, which is a common VEGF.\n\nNow, compiling all together. CellOntology has endothelial cell. GeneOntology has vasculogenesis, angiogenesis, ECM remodeling, cell proliferation. MeSH has the four terms above. Wait, the example in the user message has arrays. So I need to format all correctly.\n\nDouble-checking all IDs and terms:\n\nCellOntology:\n- CL:0000115 Endothelial cell\n\nGeneOntology:\n- GO:0001570 vasculogenesis\n- GO:0001525 angiogenesis\n- GO:0030198 extracellular"
