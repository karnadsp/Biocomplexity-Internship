        "description": "Vascular development is a complex process regulated by dynamic biological networks that vary in topology and state across different tissues and developmental stages. Signals regulating de novo blood vessel formation (vasculogenesis) and remodeling (angiogenesis) come from a variety of biological pathways linked to endothelial cell (EC) behavior, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and the local generation of chemokines and growth factors. Simulating these interactions at a systems level requires sufficient biological detail about the relevant molecular pathways and associated cellular behaviors, and tractable computational models that offset mathematical and biological complexity. Here, we describe a novel multicellular agent-based model of vasculogenesis using the CompuCell3D (http://www.compucell3d.org/) modeling environment supplemented with semi-automatic knowledgebase creation. The model incorporates vascular endothelial growth factor signals, pro- and anti-angiogenic inflammatory chemokine signals, and the plasminogen activating system of enzymes and proteases linked to ECM interactions, to simulate nascent EC organization, growth and remodeling. The model was shown to recapitulate stereotypical capillary plexus formation and structural emergence of non-coded cellular behaviors, such as a heterologous bridging phenomenon linking endothelial tip cells together during formation of polygonal endothelial cords. Molecular targets in the computational model were mapped to signatures of vascular disruption derived from in vitro chemical profiling using the EPA's ToxCast high-throughput screening (HTS) dataset. Simulating the HTS data with the cell-agent based model of vascular development predicted adverse effects of a reference anti-angiogenic thalidomide analog, 5HPP-33, on in vitro angiogenesis with respect to both concentration-response and morphological consequences. These findings support the utility of cell agent-based models for simulating a morphogenetic series of events and for the first time demonstrate the applicability of these models for predictive toxicology."

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants structured ontology annotations based on the provided biological description. They specified CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH terms. First, I need to parse the original text to identify relevant terms.\n\nStarting with CellOntology. The text mentions endothelial cells (EC), so the term here is \"endothelial cell\". Checking Cell Ontology, the correct ID for endothelial cell is CL:0000115. That goes into the CellOntology array.\n\nNext, GeneOntology. The process described includes vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. Vasculogenesis is GO:0001570, and angiogenesis is GO:0001525. Also, ECM remodeling involves extracellular matrix organization, which is GO:0030198. Additionally, cell proliferation is mentioned, which is GO:0008283. So these four GO terms should be included under GeneOntology.\n\nFor MeSH terms, the text talks about vascular endothelial growth factors, so MeSH term is \"Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors\" with ID D000092402. Extracellular matrix is another term, D005109. Plasminogen activators are involved, so \"Plasminogen Activators\" with D010957. Angiogenesis is also a MeSH term, D000096362. Finally, since toxicology is mentioned, \"Toxicology\" with D014120 should be included.\n\nNeed to ensure all IDs are correctly formatted without spaces, and terms are exact. Let me double-check each ID:\n\n- CL:0000115 for endothelial cell \u2013 correct.\n- GO:0001570 (vasculogenesis), GO:0001525 (angiogenesis), GO:0030198 (extracellular matrix organization), GO:0008283 (cell proliferation) \u2013 all valid.\n- MeSH IDs: D000092402, D005109, D010957, D000096362, D014120 \u2013 verified.\n\nTerms are correctly spelled without extra spaces. That should cover all the necessary annotations.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000115\",\n            \"term\": \"endothelial cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0001570\",\n            \"term\": \"vasculogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0001525\",\n            \"term\": \"angiogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0030198\",\n            \"term\": \"extracellular matrix organization\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0008283\",\n            \"term\": \"cell proliferation\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D000092402\",\n            \"term\": \"Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D005109\",\n            \"term\": \"Extracellular Matrix\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D010957\",\n            \"term\": \"Plasminogen Activators\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D000096362\",\n            \"term\": \"Angiogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D014120\",\n            \"term\": \"Toxicology\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```"

The user wants Python code with specific components: imports, a simulation class inheriting from SteppableBasePy, and the __init__, start, and step methods. The ontology annotations include endothelial cells, processes like vasculogenesis, angiogenesis, cell proliferation, extracellular matrix organization, and related MeSH terms like VEGF and ECM.\n\nFirst, I'll outline the necessary imports. CompuCellSetup and steppables are required. Then, the simulation class should inherit from SteppableBasePy. The __init__ method needs to call the parent's __init__. In the start method, I'll set up cell types. Since endothelial cells are involved, I'll define that cell type. The GeneOntology terms suggest processes like cell proliferation, so I'll include growth parameters. The MeSH terms mention VEGF and ECM, so maybe adding a field for ECM density and a VEGF secretion would be relevant.\n\nIn the start method, initializing cells with specific types and maybe some ECM properties. For the step method, handle cell division based on a probability to simulate proliferation. Also, maybe adjust ECM density over time or based on cell presence. I should include secretion and chemical fields for VEGF and ECM. The plugins like Volume, Contact, and Chemotaxis might be necessary. Also, include mitosis (divide) events for cell proliferation.\n\nNeed to make sure all parameters are set, like target volume, lambda volume, contact energy. For vasculogenesis and angiogenesis, chemotaxis towards VEGF could guide cell movement. The extracellular matrix organization might involve ECM degradation or secretion by cells. Adding a chemical field for VEGF and ECM, and setting up secretion in the steppable.\n\nWait, the code should have the basic structure. Let me structure the code step by step. Start with imports, then create the simulation class with the required methods. In start, initialize the cell types and possibly some initial cells. In step, handle cell division. Also, set up the simulation with appropriate plugins and parameters.\n\nCheck if all ontology elements are addressed. Cell proliferation is covered by the step method's division probability. Angiogenesis and vasculogenesis might be modeled by chemotaxis towards VEGF. Extracellular matrix organization could be handled by an ECM field and secretion parameters.
