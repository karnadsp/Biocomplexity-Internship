        "description": "Vascular development is a complex process regulated by dynamic biological networks that vary in topology and state across different tissues and developmental stages. Signals regulating de novo blood vessel formation (vasculogenesis) and remodeling (angiogenesis) come from a variety of biological pathways linked to endothelial cell (EC) behavior, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and the local generation of chemokines and growth factors. Simulating these interactions at a systems level requires sufficient biological detail about the relevant molecular pathways and associated cellular behaviors, and tractable computational models that offset mathematical and biological complexity. Here, we describe a novel multicellular agent-based model of vasculogenesis using the CompuCell3D (http://www.compucell3d.org/) modeling environment supplemented with semi-automatic knowledgebase creation. The model incorporates vascular endothelial growth factor signals, pro- and anti-angiogenic inflammatory chemokine signals, and the plasminogen activating system of enzymes and proteases linked to ECM interactions, to simulate nascent EC organization, growth and remodeling. The model was shown to recapitulate stereotypical capillary plexus formation and structural emergence of non-coded cellular behaviors, such as a heterologous bridging phenomenon linking endothelial tip cells together during formation of polygonal endothelial cords. Molecular targets in the computational model were mapped to signatures of vascular disruption derived from in vitro chemical profiling using the EPA's ToxCast high-throughput screening (HTS) dataset. Simulating the HTS data with the cell-agent based model of vascular development predicted adverse effects of a reference anti-angiogenic thalidomide analog, 5HPP-33, on in vitro angiogenesis with respect to both concentration-response and morphological consequences. These findings support the utility of cell agent-based models for simulating a morphogenetic series of events and for the first time demonstrate the applicability of these models for predictive toxicology."

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a JSON object with ontology annotations based on the provided information. Let me start by understanding the requirements. The user wants annotations in three categories: CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH. Each entry should have an exact ID and term name.\n\nFirst, looking at the original description. It talks about endothelial cells (ECs), extracellular matrix (ECM), and processes like vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. For CellOntology, \"Endothelial Cell\" is a key term. The Cell Ontology ID for endothelial cell is CL:0000115. I should make sure the term is written exactly as \"Endothelial Cell\" without any typos.\n\nNext, Gene Ontology. The processes mentioned include vasculogenesis (GO:0001570), angiogenesis (GO:0001525), and cell-matrix adhesion (GO:0007160). There's also the plasminogen activator system involved, which relates to extracellular matrix organization (GO:0030198). I need to verify each GO ID to ensure they match the correct terms. Also, the terms must be exact, so \"Vasculogenesis\" and \"Angiogenesis\" with correct capitalization.\n\nFor MeSH terms, the description mentions extracellular matrix (D004782), chemokines (D018566), growth factors (D006233), and vascular endothelial growth factors (D000094561). Wait, the MeSH ID for VEGF might be D014642, but I need to double-check. Also, \"Angiogenesis Inhibitors\" like the thalidomide analog would be D019379. Each MeSH term's ID must start with 'D' followed by numbers without spaces. Terms should be exact, so \"Extracellular Matrix\" not \"ECM\".\n\nI should also check if there are any other terms mentioned. The model involves cell proliferation and migration, but those might be covered under the existing GO terms. The ToxCast HTS dataset and predictive toxicology might relate to MeSH terms like \"High-Throughput Screening\" (D058030) and \"Toxicology\" (D014122). But since the focus is on the model predicting effects of anti-angiogenic compounds, including \"Angiogenesis Inhibitors\" makes sense.\n\nWait, the example uses \"Cell Proliferation\" as a MeSH term, but in the original text, the model includes cell behavior like organization and remodeling. Should I include \"Cell Proliferation\" here? The example might be just an example, so I need to stick to what's in the original description. The text mentions \"cell-agent based model of vascular development predicted adverse effects...\", so maybe \"Predictive Toxicology\" as a MeSH term (D014122) is applicable. But \"Toxicology\" is D014122, and \"Predictive Toxicology\" might not be a separate term. Alternatively, \"High-Throughput Screening\" (D058030) is mentioned in the ToxCast dataset.\n\nPutting it all together, the MeSH terms would include Extracellular Matrix (D004782), Chemokines (D018566), Growth Factors (D006233), Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors (D014642), and Angiogenesis Inhibitors (D019379). Also, High-Throughput Screening (D058030) and Toxicology (D014122) if applicable. But the user might prioritize terms directly related to the model's components.\n\nNeed to ensure no extra spaces in IDs. For example, VEGF's MeSH ID is D014642, not D000094561. Let me verify:\n\n- MeSH term \"Extracellular Matrix\" is D004782.\n- \"Chemokines\" is D018566.\n- \"Growth Factors\" is D006233.\n- \"Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor\" is D014642.\n- \"Angiogenesis Inhibitors\" is D019379.\n- \"High-Throughput Screening\" is D058030.\n- \"Toxicology\" is D014122.\n\nThe original text mentions predictive toxicology, so including \"Toxicology\" (D014122) and \"High-Throughput Screening\" (D058030) makes sense. But the example only includes a few terms. However, the user wants relevant terms where applicable. So including all relevant ones.\n\nNow, compiling all into the JSON structure as per the example. Categories must be exact: CellOntology, GeneOntology, MeSH. Each entry has id and term.\n\nDouble-checking the IDs and term names for exactness. No typos, correct capitalization, no extra spaces. For instance, \"Endothelial Cell\" not \"Endothelial cell\". \"Vasculogenesis\" and \"Angiogenesis\" with correct capitalization. \"Extracellular Matrix\" with exact spelling.\n\nI think that's all. Now, structure the JSON accordingly.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000115\",\n            \"term\": \"Endothelial Cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0001570\",\n            \"term\": \"Vasculogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0001525\",\n            \"term\": \"Angiogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0030198\",\n            \"term\": \"Extracellular Matrix Organization\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007160\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell-Matrix Adhesion\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D004782\",\n            \"term\": \"Extracellular Matrix\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D018566\",\n            \"term\": \"Chemokines\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D006233\",\n            \"term\": \"Growth Factors\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D014642\",\n            \"term\": \"Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D019379\",\n            \"term\": \"Angiogenesis Inhibitors\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D058030\",\n            \"term\": \"High-Throughput Screening\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D014122\",\n            \"term\": \"Toxicology\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"

MeSH terms include VEGF, ECM, growth factors, etc.\n\nSo, the simulation should involve endothelial cells interacting with the extracellular matrix, maybe forming vascular structures.
