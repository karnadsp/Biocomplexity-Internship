        "description": "Ovarian cancer relapse is often characterized by metastatic spread throughout the peritoneal cavity with tumors attached to multiple organs. In this study, interaction of ovarian cancer cells with the peritoneal tumor microenvironment was evaluated in a xenograft model based on intraperitoneal injection of fluorescent SKOV3.ip1 ovarian cancer cells. Intra-vital microscopy of mixed GFP-red fluorescent protein (RFP) cell populations injected into the peritoneum demonstrated that cancer cells aggregate and attach as mixed spheroids, emphasizing the importance of homotypic adhesion in tumor formation. Electron microscopy provided high resolution structural information about local attachment sites. Experimental measurements from the mouse model were used to build a three-dimensional cellular Potts ovarian tumor model (OvTM) that examines ovarian cancer cell attachment, chemotaxis, growth, and vascularization. OvTM simulations provide insight into the relative influence of cancer cell\u2013cell adhesion, oxygen availability, and local architecture on tumor growth and morphology. Notably, tumors on the mesentery, omentum, or spleen readily invade the \u201copen\u201d architecture, while tumors attached to the gut encounter barriers that restrict invasion and instead rapidly expand into the peritoneal space. Simulations suggest that rapid neovascularization of SKOV3.ip1 tumors is triggered by constitutive release of angiogenic factors in the absence of hypoxia. This research highlights the importance of cellular adhesion and tumor microenvironment in the seeding of secondary ovarian tumors on diverse organs within the peritoneal cavity. Results of the OvTM simulations indicate that invasion is strongly influenced by features underlying the mesothelial lining at different sites, but is also affected by local production of chemotactic factors.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a JSON object with ontology annotations based on the provided ovarian cancer study description. Let me start by identifying relevant terms for each ontology category: CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH.\n\nFirst, CellOntology. The study mentions \"ovarian cancer cells\" and \"homotypic adhesion.\" Ovarian cancer cells might correspond to a specific cell type in Cell Ontology. Let me check. Oh, there's CL:0001064 for \"neoplastic cell,\" but the term here is \"Ovarian Cancer Cell.\" Wait, maybe CL:0002271 is \"epithelial cell of ovary.\" Alternatively, maybe \"Cancer Cell\" is a general term. The example uses \"Epithelial,\" but the text refers to SKOV3.ip1 cells, which are a human ovarian carcinoma cell line. Checking the Cell Ontology, there's CL:0011115 for \"carcinoma cell,\" so the term would be \"Carcinoma Cell\" with ID CL:0011115. Also, \"homotypic adhesion\" might relate to a cell adhesion process. Wait, but CellOntology is about cell types, not processes. So maybe \"Epithelial\" as in the example, but the study mentions \"mesothelial lining,\" so mesothelial cells. CL:0000218 is \"mesothelial cell.\" So I should include that. Also, maybe \"Ovarian Cancer Cell\" but need exact term. Let me confirm. The CL has \"carcinoma cell\" as CL:0011115. So term \"Carcinoma Cell\" with that ID. And mesothelial cell CL:0000218. Also, maybe \"peritoneal cell\" but not sure. The study mentions peritoneal cavity, so maybe mesothelial cells lining it. So adding mesothelial cell.\n\nNext, GeneOntology. The processes mentioned include homotypic adhesion (GO:0007156 for cell-cell adhesion), chemotaxis (GO:0006935), angiogenesis (GO:0001525), vascularization (GO:0001944), tumor growth (maybe GO:0042102 for positive regulation of cell growth), and hypoxia response. The study says \"constitutive release of angiogenic factors in the absence of hypoxia.\" So angiogenesis terms. For homotypic adhesion, GO:0007156 is \"homophilic cell adhesion via plasma membrane adhesion molecules.\" Also, cell adhesion (GO:0007155). But the example uses \"Cell Division,\" so maybe the exact term is \"Cell-Cell Adhesion\" with GO:0016337? Wait, checking GO:0016337 is \"cell-cell adhesion.\" Alternatively, \"homotypic cell-cell adhesion\" might be a child term. Let me check. GO:0007156 is \"homophilic cell adhesion,\" which is a type of cell-cell adhesion. The study says \"homotypic adhesion,\" which is similar. So maybe use GO:0007156 with term \"Homophilic Cell Adhesion.\" Also, angiogenesis is GO:0001525 \"angiogenesis.\" Chemotaxis is GO:0006935 \"chemotaxis.\" Tumor invasion might be GO:0044344 \"cellular response to fibroblast growth factor stimulus,\" but maybe more appropriate terms. Alternatively, \"Cell Migration\" (GO:0016477). The study also mentions \"vascularization,\" so GO:0001944 \"vasculature development.\" So compiling these: Homophilic Cell Adhesion (GO:0007156), Angiogenesis (GO:0001525), Chemotaxis (GO:0006935), Vasculature Development (GO:0001944). Also, \"tumor growth\" could be GO:0042102 \"positive regulation of T cell proliferation,\" but maybe more general. Alternatively, \"Cell Proliferation\" (GO:0008283). Wait, the study mentions \"tumor growth and morphology,\" so maybe \"Cell Proliferation\" and \"Tumor Growth.\" But need exact GO terms. \"Cell proliferation\" is GO:0008283. \"Tumor growth\" might not be a direct term; perhaps \"neoplasm growth\" (GO:0072207). But the example uses \"Cell Division,\" which is GO:0008283. Hmm. The study also mentions \"vascularization,\" so including vasculature development. Also, \"release of angiogenic factors\" relates to \"angiogenesis.\" So I'll include those.\n\nFor MeSH terms, looking for concepts like \"Peritoneal Neoplasms\" (D010536), \"Neoplasm Invasiveness\" (D009361), \"Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays\" (D055645), \"Tumor Microenvironment\" (D059016), \"Neovascularization, Pathologic\" (D054044). The study uses a xenograft model, so \"Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays\" (D055645). The microenvironment is mentioned as \"tumor microenvironment\" (D059016). \"Peritoneal cavity\" relates to \"Peritoneal Neoplasms\" (D010536). \"Invasion\" is \"Neoplasm Invasiveness\" (D009361). Angiogenesis in pathology context is \"Neovascularization, Pathologic\" (D054044). Also, \"Ovarian Neoplasms\" (D010051) but the original text is about ovarian cancer relapse. However, the MeSH term for \"Ovarian Neoplasms\" is D010051. But since the study is about metastasis and relapse, maybe \"Neoplasm Metastasis\" (D009362). But let me check. The study mentions \"metastatic spread,\" so D009362. Also, \"Cell Adhesion\" (D002448) as a MeSH term. So including those.\n\nNow, assembling the JSON. Ensure category names are exact: CellOntology, GeneOntology, MeSH. IDs without spaces, terms without extra spaces.\n\nCellOntology:\n- Carcinoma Cell (CL:0011115)\n- Mesothelial Cell (CL:0000218)\n\nGeneOntology:\n- Homophilic Cell Adhesion (GO:0007156)\n- Angiogenesis (GO:0001525)\n- Chemotaxis (GO:0006935)\n- Vasculature Development (GO:0001944)\n- Cell Proliferation (GO:0008283)\n\nMeSH:\n- Peritoneal Neoplasms (D010536)\n- Neoplasm Invasiveness (D009361)\n- Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays (D055645)\n- Tumor Microenvironment (D059016)\n- Neovascularization, Pathologic (D054044)\n- Neoplasm Metastasis (D009362)\n\nCheck term spellings. For example, \"Homophilic\" not \"Homotypic\" in GO. The study mentions \"homotypic adhesion,\" but GO uses \"homophilic.\" But maybe the correct term is \"Cell-Cell Adhesion\" instead. Wait, the example uses \"Cell Division\" as term. Let me confirm GO:0007156 is \"homophilic cell adhesion via plasma membrane adhesion molecules,\" term \"Homophilic Cell Adhesion.\" Alternatively, \"Cell-Cell Adhesion\" is GO:0016337. The study says \"homotypic adhesion,\" which is a type of cell-cell adhesion. Maybe it's better to use \"Cell-Cell Adhesion\" (GO:0016337) as a broader term. But the example uses \"Cell Division\" as a term, which is more specific. The study emphasizes homotypic adhesion's importance, so perhaps the exact term is \"Cell-Cell Adhesion.\" Alternatively, if \"homotypic\" corresponds to \"homophilic,\" then GO:0007156. Need to decide based on the ontology. Since the user wants exact term names, I need to check. Homotypic adhesion is often considered synonymous with homophilic adhesion. So GO:0007156 is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for MeSH, \"Neoplasm Metastasis\" (D009362) is correct for metastatic spread. Also, \"Cell Adhesion\" (D002448) is a MeSH term. But the study mentions \"cellular adhesion\" as important, so including that. Wait, the MeSH terms already include \"Neoplasm Invasiveness\" and \"Cell Adhesion.\" So maybe:\n\nMeSH entries:\n- \"Peritoneal Neoplasms\" (D010536)\n- \"Neoplasm Invasiveness\" (D009361)\n- \"Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays\" (D055645)\n- \"Tumor Microenvironment\" (D059016)\n- \"Neovascularization, Pathologic\" (D054044)\n- \"Cell Adhesion\" (D002448)\n\nBut the original study focuses on ovarian cancer relapse and peritoneal metastasis, so \"Peritoneal Neoplasms\" is appropriate. Also, \"Ovarian Neoplasms\" (D010051) could be included, but the text specifically mentions \"ovarian cancer relapse\" and \"metastatic spread throughout the peritoneal cavity,\" so \"Peritoneal Neoplasms\" might be more relevant here.\n\nPutting it all together, ensuring the exact IDs and terms. Double-check each ID and term in the respective ontologies. For example, \"Mesothelial Cell\" is CL:0000218. \"Carcinoma Cell\" is CL:0011115. \"Homophilic Cell Adhesion\" is GO:0007156. \"Angiogenesis\" is GO:0001525. \"Chemotaxis\" is GO:0006935. \"Vasculature Development\" is GO:0001944. \"Cell Proliferation\" is GO:0008283. For MeSH, \"Peritoneal Neoplasms\" D010536, \"Neoplasm Invasiveness\" D009361, \"Xenograft"
