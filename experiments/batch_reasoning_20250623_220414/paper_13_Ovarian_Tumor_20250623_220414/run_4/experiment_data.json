      "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a JSON object with ontology annotations based on the provided information about ovarian cancer relapse. Let me start by parsing the original description to identify relevant terms for each ontology category: CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH.\n\nFirst, looking at CellOntology. The study mentions ovarian cancer cells, specifically SKOV3.ip1 cells. I should check if there's a Cell Ontology term for ovarian cancer cells. The term \"Ovarian cancer cell\" exists with ID CL:0008035. Also, homotypic adhesion and aggregation of cells are discussed, but I need to see if those are Cell Ontology terms. Alternatively, maybe \"Mesothelial cell\" since the mesothelium is part of the peritoneum. CL:1000327 is the ID for mesothelial cell. That's mentioned in the tumor microenvironment part. So I'll include both Ovarian cancer cell and Mesothelial cell under CellOntology.\n\nNext, GeneOntology. The study talks about cell adhesion, chemotaxis, tumor growth, vascularization, and angiogenesis. For GO terms, \"Cell adhesion\" is GO:0007155. \"Chemotaxis\" is GO:0006935. \"Angiogenesis\" is GO:0001525. Also, \"Vascularization\" might be covered under \"Blood vessel morphogenesis\" (GO:0048514) or similar. But the study specifically mentions neovascularization triggered by angiogenic factors, so angiogenesis is more precise. \"Tumor growth\" might correspond to \"Regulation of cell growth\" (GO:0001558) but maybe \"Cell proliferation\" (GO:0008283) is better. Wait, the example uses \"Cell Division\" as a term, but the study mentions growth and vascularization. Let me confirm the exact terms. The OvTM model examines cell attachment, chemotaxis, growth, and vascularization. So \"Cell proliferation\" (GO:0008283) for growth, \"Angiogenesis\" (GO:0001525), and \"Chemotaxis\" (GO:0006935). Also, \"Homotypic cell-cell adhesion\" is mentioned, which is GO:0034101. So those four terms: Homotypic cell-cell adhesion, Chemotaxis, Cell proliferation, Angiogenesis.\n\nFor MeSH terms, the study involves ovarian cancer relapse, peritoneal cavity, tumor microenvironment, xenograft models, neovascularization (pathologic), and maybe invasion. MeSH terms could include \"Ovarian Neoplasms\" (D010051), \"Peritoneal Cavity\" (D010537), \"Tumor Microenvironment\" (D059016), \"Neovascularization, Pathologic\" (D017353), \"Neoplasm Invasiveness\" (D009361), and \"Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays\" (D053683). The study also mentions the peritoneal cavity and mesentery, omentum, spleen, gut. But the main MeSH terms should focus on the key concepts: the cancer type, the microenvironment, xenograft models, neovascularization, and invasiveness.\n\nNow, checking the exact IDs and terms to match the formatting. CellOntology entries: CL:0008035 for Ovarian cancer cell and CL:1000327 for Mesothelial cell. GeneOntology entries: GO:0034101 (Homotypic cell-cell adhesion), GO:0006935 (Chemotaxis), GO:0008283 (Cell proliferation), GO:0001525 (Angiogenesis). MeSH entries: D010051 (Ovarian Neoplasms), D059016 (Tumor Microenvironment), D053683 (Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays), D017353 (Neovascularization, Pathologic), D009361 (Neoplasm Invasiveness).\n\nI need to ensure there are no extra spaces in terms. For example, \"Homotypic cell-cell adhesion\" is correct. \"Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays\" is the exact MeSH term. \"Neovascularization, Pathologic\" includes a comma. The IDs are correctly formatted without spaces. All right, that should cover the required terms based on the study's content.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0008035\",\n            \"term\": \"Ovarian cancer cell\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:1000327\",\n            \"term\": \"Mesothelial cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0034101\",\n            \"term\": \"Homotypic cell-cell adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0006935\",\n            \"term\": \"Chemotaxis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0008283\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell proliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0001525\",\n            \"term\": \"Angiogenesis\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D010051\",\n            \"term\": \"Ovarian Neoplasms\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D059016\",\n            \"term\": \"Tumor Microenvironment\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D053683\",\n            \"term\": \"Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D017353\",\n            \"term\": \"Neovascularization, Pathologic\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D009361\",\n            \"term\": \"Neoplasm Invasiveness\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```"

Basic cell types and parameters based on the ontology annotations",
      "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation Python file based on the provided ontology annotations. Let me start by recalling the structure of a typical CompuCell3D script.\n\nFirst, the necessary imports: CompuCellSetup and various modules from PySteppables. The user mentioned including required imports, so I'll import Simulator, SteppableBasePy, CellField, and maybe some other modules like VolumeParam if needed.\n\nNext, the simulation class must inherit from SteppableBasePy. The class should have __init__, start, and step methods. The __init__ method initializes the steppable, start is called once at the beginning, and step is called every simulation step.\n\nLooking at the ontology annotations, there are two cell types: Ovarian cancer cells and Mesothelial cells. I need to define these in the start method using self.cellTypeDict. The CellOntology terms are CL:0008035 and CL:1000327, but in CompuCell3D, we usually assign names like 'OvarianCancer' and 'Mesothelial'.\n\nFor the GeneOntology terms: Homotypic adhesion, Chemotaxis, Cell proliferation, Angiogenesis. These translate to specific CompuCell3D parameters. Homotypic adhesion would involve setting adhesion energies between same cell types. Chemotaxis might require a chemical field and a chemotaxis plugin. Cell proliferation could be handled by volume constraints leading to division. Angiogenesis might involve secretion of a chemical that promotes vascular growth, but maybe that's part of the microenvironment.\n\nMeSH terms include Tumor Microenvironment, Pathologic Neovascularization, etc. So perhaps adding a chemical field like VEGF to simulate angiogenesis. Also, Neoplasm Invasiveness could relate to cell motility parameters.\n\nIn the start method, I'll set up the cell types, adhesion energies, and initial cells. For the step method, I can check conditions for cell division based on volume. Also, enabling chemotaxis towards a chemical gradient.\n\nNeed to include the plugins: Volume, Contact, Chemotaxis. The Contact plugin handles adhesion energies. Volume plugin manages cell volume constraints. Chemotaxis for directed movement.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Imports: CompuCellSetup, SteppableBasePy, CellField, etc.\n2. Create the simulation class inheriting from SteppableBasePy.\n3. In __init__, register the relevant modules.\n4. In start, define cell types, set adhesion energies, create initial cells.\n5. In step, handle cell proliferation (maybe when volume exceeds a threshold, divide) and update chemotaxis parameters.\n6. Set up the chemical field for chemotaxis, maybe add a secretion data.\n\nWait, also need to configure the simulator with plugins. So in the main function, after initializing the simulator, add plugins like Volume, Contact, Chemotaxis, and possibly Secretion if there's a chemical involved.\n\nFor the xenograft model and tumor microenvironment, perhaps initializing a cluster of cancer cells surrounded by mesothelial cells. Use BlobInitializer to create an initial tumor mass.\n\nCheck if I need to add the Secretion plugin for the chemical field that cells chemotax towards. Let's say VEGF is the chemical, secreted by cancer cells to induce angiogenesis. Mesothelial cells might not secrete it, but cancer cells do. Then, the Chemotaxis plugin would make cancer cells move up the VEGF gradient.\n\nSo in the simulation setup, add a chemical field 'VEGF', and in the steppable's start method, set up secretion and chemotaxis parameters.\n\nPutting it all together, the code would include:\n\n- Imports\n- Simulation class with __init__, start, step\n- Setting up cell types, adhesion, initial cells\n- Configuring chemotaxis and secretion\n- Handling cell division in step\n\nI need to make sure all the plugins are properly added in the main function. Also, the XML file is generated with CompuCellSetup.generate_simulation(). But since the user wants Python-only, perhaps the XML is handled via the Python script.\n\nWait, CompuCell3D simulations often use a .cc3d file which includes XML configuration and Python scripts. But the user is asking for the Python code, so I need to make sure that all necessary setup is done within the Python script, possibly using the simulator object to register steppables and plugins.\n\nLet me structure the code step by step:\n\nStart with imports:\n\nfrom pyevtk.hl import *\nfrom math import *\nimport sys\nimport os\nimport numpy as np\nfrom random import random\nimport CompuCellSetup\nfrom PySteppables import *\n\nThen, the main simulation class:\n\nclass SimulationSteppable(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, simulator, frequency=1):\n        super().__init__(simulator, frequency)\n        self.cell_field = simulator.getPotts().getCellField()\n        self.dim = simulator.getPotts().getCellFieldG().getDim()\n\n    def start(self):\n        # Define cell types\n        self.cellTypeOvarianCancer = self.addCellType(\"OvarianCancer\")\n        self.cellTypeMesothelial = self.addCellType(\"Mesothelial\")\n        \n        # Set adhesion parameters\n        self.getContactEnergy(self.cellTypeOvarianCancer, self.cellTypeOvarianCancer).setContactEnergy(10)\n        self.getContactEnergy(self.cellTypeOvarianCancer, self.cellTypeMesothelial).setContactEnergy(20)\n        self.getContactEnergy(self.cellTypeMesothelial, self.cellTypeMesothelial).setContactEnergy(15)\n        \n        # Setup initial cells\n        for i in range(100):\n            x = int(random() * self.dim.x)\n            y = int(random() * self.dim.y)\n            z = 0\n            cell = self.newCell(self.cellTypeOvarianCancer)\n            self.cell_field.set(x, y, z, cell)\n        \n        for i in range(200):\n            x = int(random() * self.dim.x)\n            y = int(random() * self.dim.y)\n            z = 0\n            cell = self.newCell(self.cellTypeMesothelial)\n            self.cell_field.set(x, y, z, cell)\n        \n        # Setup chemotaxis\n        chemo_plugin = CompuCell.getChemotaxisPlugin()\n        chemo_plugin.addChemicalField(\"VEGF\")\n        for cell in self.cell_list:\n            if cell.type == self.cellTypeOvarianCancer:\n                chemo_data = chemo_plugin.getChemotaxisData(cell)\n                chemo_data.setLambda(500)\n                chemo_data.registerChemicalField(\"VEGF\", 1.0)\n        \n        # Setup secretion\n        secretion_plugin = CompuCell.getSecretionPlugin()\n        secretion_plugin.addSecretor(\"VEGF\", self.cellTypeOvarianCancer)\n        secretion_plugin.setSecretion(\"VEGF\", self.cellTypeOvarianCancer, 0.1)\n    \n    def step(self, mcs):\n        for cell in self.cell_list:\n            if cell.type == self.cellTypeOvarianCancer:\n                # Cell proliferation: divide when volume exceeds threshold\n                if cell.volume > 50:\n                    self.divideCellRandomOrientation(cell)\n                # Update chemotaxis parameters if needed\n\nThen, the main setup:\n\ndef configure_simulation():\n    simulator = CompuCellSetup.Simulator()\n    dim_x, dim_y, dim_z = 100, 100, 1\n    simulator.registerSteppable(SimulationSteppable(simulator))\n    CompuCellSetup.generateSimulation(simulator)\n    \n    # Configure plugins\n    simulator.getPotts().setDimX(dim_x)\n    simulator.getPotts().setDimY(dim_y)\n    simulator.getPotts().setDimZ(dim_z)\n    \n    # Add necessary plugins\n    simulator.registerPlugin(VolumePlugin())\n    simulator.registerPlugin(ContactPlugin())\n    simulator.registerPlugin(ChemotaxisPlugin())\n    simulator.registerPlugin(SecretionPlugin())\n    \n    return simulator\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    simulator = configure_simulation()\n    CompuCellSetup.runSimulation(simulator)\n\nWait, but in CompuCell3D Python scripts, often the main part is handled via CompuCellSetup. Also, plugins are usually added via XML, but here we need to do it in Python. However, I might need to adjust the code to properly register the plugins through the simulator object.\n\nAlternatively, the user might expect the code to use the standard setup where the XML is generated via the Python script. However, since the user specified to return only the Python code, I need to ensure that all necessary configurations are in the Python script.\n\nAlso, the VolumePlugin requires parameters. Each cell type might have target volume and lambda parameters. For example:\n\nIn the start method:\n\nvolume_plugin = self.getVolumePlugin()\nvolume_plugin.setLambdaVolume(self.cellTypeOvarianCancer, 2.0)\nvolume_plugin.setTargetVolume(self.cellTypeOvarianCancer, 25)\nvolume_plugin.setLambdaVolume(self.cellTypeMesothelial, 2.0)\nvolume_plugin.setTargetVolume(self.cellTypeMesothelial, 25)\n\nBut wait, in CompuCell3D, the VolumePlugin handles volume constraints. Each cell type can have its own target volume and lambda. So in the start method, after defining cell types, set their volume parameters.\n\n"

Let me start by parsing the original description to identify relevant terms for each ontology category: CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH.\n\nFirst, looking at CellOntology. The study mentions ovarian cancer cells, specifically SKOV3.ip1 cells. I should check if there's a Cell Ontology term for ovarian cancer cells. The term \"Ovarian cancer cell\" exists with ID CL:0008035. Also, homotypic adhesion and aggregation of cells are discussed, but I need to see if those are Cell Ontology terms. Alternatively, maybe \"Mesothelial cell\" since the mesothelium is part of the peritoneum. CL:1000327 is the ID for mesothelial cell. That's mentioned in the tumor microenvironment part. So I'll include both Ovarian cancer cell and Mesothelial cell under CellOntology.\n\nNext, GeneOntology. The study talks about cell adhesion, chemotaxis, tumor growth, vascularization, and angiogenesis. For GO terms, \"Cell adhesion\" is GO:0007155. \"Chemotaxis\" is GO:0006935. \"Angiogenesis\" is GO:0001525. Also, \"Vascularization\" might be covered under \"Blood vessel morphogenesis\" (GO:0048514) or similar. But the study specifically mentions neovascularization triggered by angiogenic factors, so angiogenesis is more precise. \"Tumor growth\" might correspond to \"Regulation of cell growth\" (GO:0001558) but maybe \"Cell proliferation\" (GO:0008283) is better. Wait, the example uses \"Cell Division\" as a term, but the study mentions growth and vascularization. Let me confirm the exact terms. The OvTM model examines cell attachment, chemotaxis, growth, and vascularization. So \"Cell proliferation\" (GO:0008283) for growth, \"Angiogenesis\" (GO:0001525), and \"Chemotaxis\" (GO:0006935). Also, \"Homotypic cell-cell adhesion\" is mentioned, which is GO:0034101. So those four terms: Homotypic cell-cell adhesion, Chemotaxis, Cell proliferation, Angiogenesis.\n\nFor MeSH terms, the study involves ovarian cancer relapse, peritoneal cavity, tumor microenvironment, xenograft models, neovascularization (pathologic), and maybe invasion. MeSH terms could include \"Ovarian Neoplasms\" (D010051), \"Peritoneal Cavity\" (D010537), \"Tumor Microenvironment\" (D059016), \"Neovascularization, Pathologic\" (D017353), \"Neoplasm Invasiveness\" (D009361), and \"Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays\" (D053683). The study also mentions the peritoneal cavity and mesentery, omentum, spleen, gut. But the main MeSH terms should focus on the key concepts: the cancer type, the microenvironment, xenograft models, neovascularization, and invasiveness.\n\nNow, checking the exact IDs and terms to match the formatting. CellOntology entries: CL:0008035 for Ovarian cancer cell and CL:1000327 for Mesothelial cell. GeneOntology entries: GO:0034101 (Homotypic cell-cell adhesion), GO:0006935 (Chemotaxis), GO:0008283 (Cell proliferation), GO:0001525 (Angiogenesis). MeSH entries: D010051 (Ovarian Neoplasms), D059016 (Tumor Microenvironment), D053683 (Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays), D017353 (Neovascularization, Pathologic), D009361 (Neoplasm Invasiveness).\n\nI need to ensure there are no extra spaces in terms. For example, \"Homotypic cell-cell adhesion\" is correct. \"Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays\" is the exact MeSH term. \"Neovascularization, Pathologic\" includes a comma. The IDs are correctly formatted without spaces. All right, that should cover the required terms based on the study's content.\n</think>",

The __init__ method initializes the steppable, start is called once at the beginning, and step is called every simulation step.\n\nLooking at the ontology annotations, there are two cell types: Ovarian cancer cells and Mesothelial cells. I need to define these in the start method using self.cellTypeDict. The CellOntology terms are CL:0008035 and CL:1000327, but in CompuCell3D, we usually assign names like 'OvarianCancer' and 'Mesothelial'.\n\nFor the GeneOntology terms: Homotypic adhesion, Chemotaxis, Cell proliferation, Angiogenesis. These translate to specific CompuCell3D parameters. Homotypic adhesion would involve setting adhesion energies between same cell types. Chemotaxis might require a chemical field and a chemotaxis plugin. Cell proliferation could be handled by volume constraints leading to division. Angiogenesis might involve secretion of a chemical that promotes vascular growth, but maybe that's part of the microenvironment.\n\nMeSH terms include Tumor Microenvironment, Pathologic Neovascularization, etc. So perhaps adding a chemical field like VEGF to simulate angiogenesis. Also, Neoplasm Invasiveness could relate to cell motility parameters.\n\nIn the start method, I'll set up the cell types, adhesion energies, and initial cells. For the step method, I can check conditions for cell division based on volume. Also, enabling chemotaxis towards a chemical gradient.\n\nNeed to include the plugins: Volume, Contact, Chemotaxis. The Contact plugin handles adhesion energies. Volume plugin manages cell volume constraints. Chemotaxis for directed movement.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Imports: CompuCellSetup, SteppableBasePy, CellField, etc.\n2. Create the simulation class inheriting from SteppableBasePy.\n3. In __init__, register the relevant modules.\n4. In start, define cell types, set adhesion energies, create initial cells.\n5. In step, handle cell proliferation (maybe when volume exceeds a threshold, divide) and update chemotaxis parameters.\n6. Set up the chemical field for chemotaxis, maybe add a secretion data.\n\nWait, also need to configure the simulator with plugins. So in the main function, after initializing the simulator, add plugins like Volume, Contact, Chemotaxis, and possibly Secretion if there's a chemical involved.\n\nFor the xenograft model and tumor microenvironment, perhaps initializing a cluster of cancer cells surrounded by mesothelial cells. Use BlobInitializer to create an initial tumor mass.\n\nCheck if I need to add the Secretion plugin for the chemical field that cells chemotax towards. Let's say VEGF is the chemical, secreted by cancer cells to induce angiogenesis. Mesothelial cells might not secrete it, but cancer cells do. Then, the Chemotaxis plugin would make cancer cells move up the VEGF gradient.\n\nSo in the simulation setup, add a chemical field 'VEGF', and in the steppable's start method, set up secretion and chemotaxis parameters.\n\nPutting it all together, the code would include:\n\n- Imports\n- Simulation class with __init__, start, step\n- Setting up cell types, adhesion, initial cells\n- Configuring chemotaxis and secretion\n- Handling cell division in step\n\nI need to make sure all the plugins are properly added in the main function. Also, the XML file is generated with CompuCellSetup.generate_simulation(). But since the user wants Python-only, perhaps the XML is handled via the Python script.\n\nWait, CompuCell3D simulations often use a .cc3d file which includes XML configuration and Python scripts. But the user is asking for the Python code, so I need to make sure that all necessary setup is done within the Python script, possibly using the simulator object to register steppables and plugins.\n\nLet me structure the code step by step:\n\nStart with imports:\n\nfrom pyevtk.hl import *\nfrom math import *\nimport sys\nimport os\nimport numpy as np\nfrom random import random\nimport CompuCellSetup\nfrom PySteppables import *\n\nThen, the main simulation class:\n\nclass SimulationSteppable(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, simulator, frequency=1):\n        super().__init__(simulator, frequency)\n        self.cell_field = simulator.getPotts().getCellField()\n        self.dim = simulator.getPotts().getCellFieldG().getDim()\n\n    def start(self):\n        # Define cell types\n        self.cellTypeOvarianCancer = self.addCellType(\"OvarianCancer\")\n        self.cellTypeMesothelial = self.addCellType(\"Mesothelial\")\n        \n        # Set adhesion parameters\n        self.getContactEnergy(self.cellTypeOvarianCancer, self.cellTypeOvarianCancer).setContactEnergy(10)\n        self.getContactEnergy(self.cellTypeOvarianCancer, self.cellTypeMesothelial).setContactEnergy(20)\n        self.getContactEnergy(self.cellTypeMesothelial, self.cellTypeMesothelial).setContactEnergy(15)\n        \n        # Setup initial cells\n        for i in range(100):\n            x = int(random() * self.dim.x)\n            y = int(random() * self.dim.y)\n            z = 0\n            cell = self.newCell(self.cellTypeOvarianCancer)\n            self.cell_field.set(x, y, z, cell)\n        \n        for i in range(200):\n            x = int(random() * self.dim.x)\n            y = int(random() * self.dim.y)\n            z = 0\n            cell = self.newCell(self.cellTypeMesothelial)\n            self.cell_field.set(x, y, z, cell)\n        \n        # Setup chemotaxis\n        chemo_plugin = CompuCell.getChemotaxisPlugin()\n        chemo_plugin.addChemicalField(\"VEGF\")\n        for cell in self.cell_list:\n            if cell.type == self.cellTypeOvarianCancer:\n                chemo_data = chemo_plugin.getChemotaxisData(cell)\n                chemo_data.setLambda(500)\n                chemo_data.registerChemicalField(\"VEGF\", 1.0)\n        \n        # Setup secretion\n        secretion_plugin = CompuCell.getSecretionPlugin()\n        secretion_plugin.addSecretor(\"VEGF\", self.cellTypeOvarianCancer)\n        secretion_plugin.setSecretion(\"VEGF\", self.cellTypeOvarianCancer, 0.1)\n    \n    def step(self, mcs):\n        for cell in self.cell_list:\n            if cell.type == self.cellTypeOvarianCancer:\n                # Cell proliferation: divide when volume exceeds threshold\n                if cell.volume > 50:\n                    self.divideCellRandomOrientation(cell)\n                # Update chemotaxis parameters if needed\n\nThen, the main setup:\n\ndef configure_simulation():\n    simulator = CompuCellSetup.Simulator()\n    dim_x, dim_y, dim_z = 100, 100, 1\n    simulator.registerSteppable(SimulationSteppable(simulator))\n    CompuCellSetup.generateSimulation(simulator)\n    \n    # Configure plugins\n    simulator.getPotts().setDimX(dim_x)\n    simulator.getPotts().setDimY(dim_y)\n    simulator.getPotts().setDimZ(dim_z)\n    \n    # Add necessary plugins\n    simulator.registerPlugin(VolumePlugin())\n    simulator.registerPlugin(ContactPlugin())\n    simulator.registerPlugin(ChemotaxisPlugin())\n    simulator.registerPlugin(SecretionPlugin())\n    \n    return simulator\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    simulator = configure_simulation()\n    CompuCellSetup.runSimulation(simulator)\n\nWait, but in CompuCell3D Python scripts, often the main part is handled via CompuCellSetup. Also, plugins are usually added via XML, but here we need to do it in Python. However, I might need to adjust the code to properly register the plugins through the simulator object.\n\nAlternatively, the user might expect the code to use the standard setup where the XML is generated via the Python script. However, since the user specified to return only the Python code, I need to ensure that all necessary configurations are in the Python script.\n\nAlso, the VolumePlugin requires parameters. Each cell type might have target volume and lambda parameters. For example:\n\nIn the start method:\n\nvolume_plugin = self.getVolumePlugin()\nvolume_plugin.setLambdaVolume(self.cellTypeOvarianCancer, 2.0)\nvolume_plugin.setTargetVolume(self.cellTypeOvarianCancer, 25)\nvolume_plugin.setLambdaVolume(self.cellTypeMesothelial, 2.0)\nvolume_plugin.setTargetVolume(self.cellTypeMesothelial, 25)\n\nBut wait, in CompuCell3D, the VolumePlugin handles volume constraints. Each cell type can have its own target volume and lambda. So in the start method, after defining cell types, set their volume parameters.",
