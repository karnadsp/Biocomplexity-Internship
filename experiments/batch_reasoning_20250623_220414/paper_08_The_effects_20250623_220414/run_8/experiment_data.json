        "description": "There are numerous biological examples where genes associated with migratory ability of cells also confer the cells with an increased fitness even though these genes may not have any known effect on the cell mitosis rates. Here, we provide insight into these observations by analyzing the effects of cell migration, compression, and contact inhibition on the growth of tumor cell clusters using the Cellular Potts Model (CPM) in a monolayer geometry. This is a follow-up of a previous study (Thalhauser et al. 2010) in which a Moran-type model was used to study the interaction of cell proliferation, migratory potential and death on the emergence of invasive phenotypes. Here, we extend the study to include the effects of cell size and shape. In particular, we investigate the interplay between cell motility and compressibility within the CPM and find that the CPM predicts that increased cell motility leads to smaller cells. This is an artifact in the CPM. An analysis of the CPM reveals an explicit inverse-relationship between the cell stiffness and motility parameters. We use this relationship to compensate for motility-induced changes in cell size in the CPM so that in the corrected CPM, cell size is independent of the cell motility. We find that subject to comparable levels of compression, clusters of motile cells grow faster than clusters of less motile cells, in qualitative agreement with biological observations and our previous study. Increasing compression tends to reduce growth rates. Contact inhibition penalizes clumped cells by halting their growth and gives motile cells an even greater advantage. Finally, our model predicts cell size distributions that are consistent with those observed in clusters of neuroblastoma cells cultured in low and high density conditions."

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me start by breaking down the original description to identify key concepts that need ontology annotations. The main topics mentioned are cell migration, tumor cell clusters, Cellular Potts Model, cell motility, cell size and shape, contact inhibition, neuroblastoma cells, cell proliferation, and invasive phenotypes.\n\nFirst, for CellOntology. The text mentions tumor cell clusters and neuroblastoma cells. Tumor cells would fall under \"CL:0000000\" but wait, checking the actual Cell Ontology, the term for tumor cell might have a specific ID. Alternatively, neuroblastoma cells are a type of neuron, maybe \"CL:0000540\" (Neuroblast). But I need to confirm if that's the correct CL ID. Another term could be \"Malignant cell\" which is CL:0001064. Hmm. Since the study uses tumor cell clusters, maybe \"CL:0000003\" (Neoplastic Cell) is more appropriate. Wait, checking the Cell Ontology, CL:0001064 is \"malignant cell\", which is a neoplastic cell. So that's better. Also, neuroblastoma cells: neuroblastoma is a cancer of neuroblasts. CL:0000579 is \"neuroblast\". But maybe the term is \"Neuroblastoma cell\" specifically. However, I need to check if that exact term exists. If not, maybe use the general neoplastic cell. Alternatively, maybe \"CL:0000579\" is the correct ID for neuroblast. I'll have to make a best guess here.\n\nNext, GeneOntology. The processes involved include cell migration (GO:0016477 - cell migration), cell motility (same as migration?), cell proliferation (GO:0008283 - cell proliferation), contact inhibition (GO:0060242 - contact inhibition), cell size regulation (GO:0008361 - regulation of cell size), and cell death (though not directly mentioned, but the previous study had cell death). Also, the study talks about cell cluster growth, which might relate to \"multicellular organism growth\" (GO:0035264). But the key terms here are cell migration, cell proliferation, contact inhibition, and regulation of cell size.\n\nFor MeSH terms, topics include Cell Movement (MeSH D002465), Cell Proliferation (D049109), Contact Inhibition (D003267), Neuroblastoma (D009447), Neoplasm Invasiveness (D009361), and Cell Size (D002471). The Cellular Potts Model might not have a MeSH term, but the biological processes do. Also, compression effects could relate to \"Mechanical Stress\" (D058530) or \"Cell Compartmentalization\" (D002465?), but maybe \"Cell Compression\" isn't a MeSH term. Alternatively, \"Cell Adhesion\" (D015815) might be relevant due to contact inhibition.\n\nNow, structuring the JSON. Make sure category names are exact: \"CellOntology\", \"GeneOntology\", \"MeSH\". IDs without spaces. Terms exact without extra spaces.\n\nFor CellOntology:\n- Tumor cell cluster: Maybe \"CL:0001064\" (malignant cell) as the term is \"Malignant cell\". Or \"CL:0000003\" (Neoplastic cell). Let's check. CL:0001064 is \"malignant cell\", which is a type of neoplastic cell. Since the study is about tumor cells, that's appropriate. Neuroblastoma cells: CL:0000579 (neuroblast) if that's the closest, or perhaps \"CL:0001064\" again. But if there's a specific term for neuroblastoma cells, that's better. Alternatively, maybe \"CL:0000579\" (neuroblast) is correct. But I need to verify. Suppose the correct term for neuroblastoma cell is CL:0000579, then include that. However, I might have to use \"Malignant cell\" and \"Neuroblast\" here.\n\nGeneOntology:\n- Cell migration: GO:0016477\n- Cell motility: Same as migration? GO:0016477\n- Cell proliferation: GO:0008283\n- Contact inhibition: GO:0060242\n- Regulation of cell size: GO:0008361\n\nMeSH:\n- Cell Movement: D002465\n- Cell Proliferation: D049109\n- Contact Inhibition: D003267\n- Neuroblastoma: D009447\n- Neoplasm Invasiveness: D009361\n- Cell Size: D002471\n\nWait, the original text mentions \"cell compression\" and \"compressibility\". Is there a MeSH term for that? Maybe \"Mechanical Phenomena\" (D008462) or \"Stress, Mechanical\" (D058530). Alternatively, \"Cell Shape\" (D002471 is Cell Size, but Cell Shape is D002472). Let me check. MeSH D002472 is \"Cell Shape\". Also, \"Cell Size\" is D002471. So include Cell Size and Cell Shape. But the study talks about cell size and shape, so both might be relevant. However, the example given in the problem includes only Cell Proliferation and such, so perhaps include those.\n\nPutting it all together. Make sure each category has the exact terms and IDs. Check for duplicates. For instance, in GeneOntology, cell migration and motility might be the same, but perhaps the term is \"cell migration\" (GO:0016477). Contact inhibition is GO:0060242. Cell proliferation is GO:0008283. Regulation of cell size is GO:0008361. \n\nFor MeSH, Cell Movement (D002465), Cell Proliferation (D049109), Contact Inhibition (D003267), Neuroblastoma (D009447), Neoplasm Invasiveness (D009361), Cell Size (D002471), and perhaps Cell Shape (D002472).\n\nNow, structure the JSON accordingly. Ensure no extra spaces in IDs and terms. Check the example given. Avoid any explanations, just the JSON.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0001064\",\n            \"term\": \"Malignant cell\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000579\",\n            \"term\": \"Neuroblast\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0016477\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Migration\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0008283\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Proliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0060242\",\n            \"term\": \"Contact Inhibition\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0008361\",\n            \"term\": \"Regulation of Cell Size\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002465\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Movement\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D049109\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Proliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D003267\",\n            \"term\": \"Contact Inhibition\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D009447\",\n            \"term\": \"Neuroblastoma\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D009361\",\n            \"term\": \"Neoplasm Invasiveness\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002471\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Size\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"

Basic cell types and parameters based on the ontology annotations",
      "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file based on the provided ontology annotations. Let me start by recalling the structure of a typical CompuCell3D Python script.\n\nFirst, the necessary imports: CompuCellSetup and the steppables module. That's straightforward. Then, the simulation class should inherit from steppables.SteppableBasePy. The class needs __init__, start, and step methods.\n\nLooking at the ontology annotations, the cell types are Malignant cell (CL:0001064) and Neuroblast (CL:0000579). So I'll define these cell types in the start method using the cellField. Also, I need to set their properties based on the GeneOntology and MeSH terms mentioned.\n\nThe GeneOntology terms include Regulation of Cell Size, Cell Migration, Cell Proliferation, Contact Inhibition. MeSH terms include Cell Size, Contact Inhibition, Neoplasm Invasiveness, etc. This suggests that the simulation should involve parameters related to cell growth, division, movement, and contact inhibition.\n\nIn the start method, I should initialize the two cell types. Maybe assign different parameters like target volume, lambda volume, and motility properties. For example, malignant cells might have higher motility and less contact inhibition compared to neuroblasts.\n\nIn the step method, handle cell proliferation. Check if a cell's volume exceeds a threshold to trigger division. Also, apply contact inhibition by preventing division if there are too many neighbors. But wait, how to implement contact inhibition? Maybe check the number of neighboring cells and only allow division if below a certain number.\n\nAlso, cell migration could be handled by setting the motility parameters in the plugin. Maybe use the Motility plugin and set the motility parameters for each cell type.\n\nWait, in CompuCell3D, cell movement is typically handled through the plugins like Volume, Contact, and Motility. So I need to configure these plugins. The Contact plugin enforces adhesion energies between cell types, affecting how they sort. The Motility plugin controls the direction and persistence of cell movement.\n\nSo in the start method, after creating the cells, I should assign each cell type their respective parameters. For example, malignant cells might have higher motility, lower adhesion (to be more invasive), and different target volumes.\n\nAlso, cell proliferation is managed in the step method. Each time step, check if the cell's volume is above a threshold, then divide. But contact inhibition would require checking the surrounding cells. Maybe count the number of neighboring cells and only allow division if the count is below a threshold.\n\nHmm, the user mentioned Contact Inhibition (GO:0060242) and in MeSH. So in the step method, before allowing a cell to divide, check the number of neighboring cells. If too many, inhibit division.\n\nPutting this together, in the step function, loop over each cell, check if it's a malignant or neuroblast. For each, check if volume exceeds threshold. Then check neighbors count. If neighbors < some number, allow division.\n\nAlso, set up the plugins in the XML file, but since the user wants only the Python code, maybe include the necessary plugin configurations via the Python script. Wait, some parameters are set in the XML, but in CompuCell3D's Python interface, you can set up plugins via the simulator object.\n\nWait, the user wants the code to include the necessary imports, simulation class, methods, and basic parameters. So perhaps the code will configure the plugins (like Volume, Contact, Motility) within the Python script.\n\nLet me outline the code structure:\n\nImports: CompuCellSetup, steppables, and maybe some modules like cc3d.CompuCell.\n\nSimulation class inheriting from SteppableBasePy. In __init__, call the parent __init__. In start, set up cell types and initial cells. In step, handle cell proliferation and contact inhibition.\n\nFor the plugins, perhaps in the start method, configure the VolumeEnergy parameters (lambda volume, target volume) for each cell type. Similarly, set up ContactEnergy between cell types. Also, configure Motility parameters for each cell.\n\nWait, the Volume plugin is typically configured in the XML, but maybe here they are set via the simulator. Alternatively, in the Python code, you can access the plugin objects and set their parameters.\n\nSo in the start method:\n\n- Get the volume plugin and set lambda and target volume for each cell type.\n- Get the contact plugin and set adhesion energies between cell types.\n- Get the motility plugin and set motility parameters for each cell type.\n\nBut how to access these plugins in the Python code? Let me recall. The simulator object has access to the plugin managers. For example, to configure the Volume energy:\n\nvolume_plugin = CompuCell.getConcentrationField(self.simulator, \"Volume\")\nWait, maybe it's done through the simulator object's getSteppableByType method or similar. Alternatively, perhaps using the steppable's reference to the simulator.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the parameters are set in the XML, but the user wants the Python code. So perhaps the code should include the necessary XML configuration, but the user specified to return only the Python code. Hmm, but the user said \"Generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file\" which is a .py file that includes the necessary setup. So in the Python code, they might not include the XML, but configure the plugins via the Python interface.\n\nWait, perhaps in the start method, you can set the parameters for each cell type using the simulator's plugin system.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code uses the CellTypePlugin to define cell types, and then assigns parameters via dictionaries.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the start method, after creating cells, assign their target volume, lambda volume, and other attributes.\n\nLet me think. For each cell, you can set targetVolume and lambdaVolume attributes. The Volume plugin uses these parameters. Similarly, the Contact plugin requires setting adhesion energies between cell types. The Motility plugin would set parameters like motility, persistence, etc.\n\nSo, in the start method:\n\n- Create cell types using self.cellType = self.createCellType(\"Malignant\") etc.\nWait, maybe using the cellField to create cells.\n\nWait, in CompuCell3D's Python interface, to create a cell, you can use the cellField to place a cell at a specific location. Then, set the type of the cell.\n\nThen, for each cell, assign the targetVolume, lambdaVolume, etc. These parameters are used by the Volume plugin to calculate energy.\n\nSimilarly, for motility, assign parameters like motility=30, persistenceTime=10, etc. These are used by the Motility plugin.\n\nSo, putting this together:\n\nIn the start method:\n\nmalignant_type = self.cellType(\"Malignant\")\nneuroblast_type = self.cellType(\"Neuroblast\")\n\nThen, create cells of these types. But how to define cell types? Wait, perhaps using the CellTypePlugin. Maybe the code defines cell types first.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the start method, we can directly assign the type to cells.\n\nLet me proceed step by step.\n\nThe code should start with:\n\nimport CompuCellSetup\nfrom PySteppables import SteppableBasePy\n\nThen, the simulation class:\n\nclass SimulationSteppable(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, simulator, frequency=1):\n        SteppableBasePy.__init__(self, simulator, frequency)\n\n    def start(self):\n        # Code to initialize cell types and cells\n\n    def step(self, mcs):\n        # Code for each simulation step\n\nIn the start method, create cell types. Wait, in CompuCell3D, cell types are usually defined in the XML, but perhaps in the Python script, you can create them. Alternatively, the code may use the cellTypePlugin to define types.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code can directly assign cell types by name. For example:\n\ncell = self.cellField[x, y, z]\ncell.type = self.MALIGNANT\n\nBut first, the code needs to define the cell types. Let me check. The CellTypePlugin is required, and cell types can be defined in the XML. But the user wants the code to be self-contained. So perhaps the code includes the necessary setup.\n\nWait, perhaps in the start method, the code creates the cell types by name. Then, when creating cells, assigns the type by that name.\n\nSo, in the start method:\n\nmalignant_type = self.addCellType(\"Malignant\")\nneuroblast_type = self.addCellType(\"Neuroblast\")\n\nWait, maybe that's not the correct method. Alternatively, perhaps using the cellTypePlugin:\n\ncell_type_plugin = self.getCellTypePlugin()\nmalignant_type = cell_type_plugin.addType(\"Malignant\")\nneuroblast_type = cell_type_plugin.addType(\"Neuroblast\")\n\nYes, that's likely. So in the start method, the code accesses the cell type plugin and adds the types.\n\nThen, create cells of those types.\n\nFor example, create a malignant cell at position (x,y,z):\n\ncell = self.cellField[x][y][z]\nif cell is None:\n    cell = self.potts.createCell()\n    cell.type = malignant_type\n    self.cellField[x][y][z] = cell\n\nBut to keep the example simple, perhaps just create a few cells for each type.\n\nOnce the cells are created, set their parameters:\n\ncell.targetVolume = 25\ncell.lambdaVolume = 2.0\ncell.motility = 50  # For malignant cells, higher motility\n\nSimilarly for neuroblast cells:\n\ncell.targetVolume = 20"

GO:0016477\n- Cell proliferation: GO:0008283\n- Contact inhibition: GO:0060242\n- Regulation of cell size: GO:0008361\n\nMeSH:\n- Cell Movement: D002465\n- Cell Proliferation: D049109\n- Contact Inhibition: D003267\n- Neuroblastoma: D009447\n- Neoplasm Invasiveness: D009361\n- Cell Size: D002471\n\nWait, the original text mentions \"cell compression\" and \"compressibility\". Is there a MeSH term for that? Maybe \"Mechanical Phenomena\" (D008462) or \"Stress, Mechanical\" (D058530). Alternatively, \"Cell Shape\" (D002471 is Cell Size, but Cell Shape is D002472). Let me check. MeSH D002472 is \"Cell Shape\". Also, \"Cell Size\" is D002471. So include Cell Size and Cell Shape. But the study talks about cell size and shape, so both might be relevant. However, the example given in the problem includes only Cell Proliferation and such, so perhaps include those.\n\nPutting it all together. Make sure each category has the exact terms and IDs. Check for duplicates. For instance, in GeneOntology, cell migration and motility might be the same, but perhaps the term is \"cell migration\" (GO:0016477). Contact inhibition is GO:0060242. Cell proliferation is GO:0008283. Regulation of cell size is GO:0008361. \n\nFor MeSH, Cell Movement (D002465), Cell Proliferation (D049109), Contact Inhibition (D003267), Neuroblastoma (D009447), Neoplasm Invasiveness (D009361), Cell Size (D002471), and perhaps Cell Shape (D002472).\n\nNow, structure the JSON accordingly. Ensure no extra spaces in IDs and terms. Check the example given. Avoid any explanations, just the JSON.\n</think>",

      "python_code": "from cc3d.core.PySteppables import *\n\n<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file based on the provided ontology annotations. Let me start by recalling the structure of a typical CompuCell3D Python script.\n\nFirst, the necessary imports: CompuCellSetup and the steppables module. That's straightforward. Then, the simulation class should inherit from steppables.SteppableBasePy. The class needs __init__, start, and step methods.\n\nLooking at the ontology annotations, the cell types are Malignant cell (CL:0001064) and Neuroblast (CL:0000579). So I'll define these cell types in the start method using the cellField. Also, I need to set their properties based on the GeneOntology and MeSH terms mentioned.\n\nThe GeneOntology terms include Regulation of Cell Size, Cell Migration, Cell Proliferation, Contact Inhibition. MeSH terms include Cell Size, Contact Inhibition, Neoplasm Invasiveness, etc. This suggests that the simulation should involve parameters related to cell growth, division, movement, and contact inhibition.\n\nIn the start method, I should initialize the two cell types. Maybe assign different parameters like target volume, lambda volume, and motility properties. For example, malignant cells might have higher motility and less contact inhibition compared to neuroblasts.\n\nIn the step method, handle cell proliferation. Check if a cell's volume exceeds a threshold to trigger division. Also, apply contact inhibition by preventing division if there are too many neighbors. But wait, how to implement contact inhibition? Maybe check the number of neighboring cells and only allow division if below a certain number.\n\nAlso, cell migration could be handled by setting the motility parameters in the plugin. Maybe use the Motility plugin and set the motility parameters for each cell type.\n\nWait, in CompuCell3D, cell movement is typically handled through the plugins like Volume, Contact, and Motility. So I need to configure these plugins. The Contact plugin enforces adhesion energies between cell types, affecting how they sort. The Motility plugin controls the direction and persistence of cell movement.\n\nSo in the start method, after creating the cells, I should assign each cell type their respective parameters. For example, malignant cells might have higher motility, lower adhesion (to be more invasive), and different target volumes.\n\nAlso, cell proliferation is managed in the step method. Each time step, check if the cell's volume is above a threshold, then divide. But contact inhibition would require checking the surrounding cells. Maybe count the number of neighboring cells and only allow division if the count is below a threshold.\n\nHmm, the user mentioned Contact Inhibition (GO:0060242) and in MeSH. So in the step method, before allowing a cell to divide, check the number of neighboring cells. If too many, inhibit division.\n\nPutting this together, in the step function, loop over each cell, check if it's a malignant or neuroblast. For each, check if volume exceeds threshold. Then check neighbors count. If neighbors < some number, allow division.\n\nAlso, set up the plugins in the XML file, but since the user wants only the Python code, maybe include the necessary plugin configurations via the Python script. Wait, some parameters are set in the XML, but in CompuCell3D's Python interface, you can set up plugins via the simulator object.\n\nWait, the user wants the code to include the necessary imports, simulation class, methods, and basic parameters. So perhaps the code will configure the plugins (like Volume, Contact, Motility) within the Python script.\n\nLet me outline the code structure:\n\nImports: CompuCellSetup, steppables, and maybe some modules like cc3d.CompuCell.\n\nSimulation class inheriting from SteppableBasePy. In __init__, call the parent __init__. In start, set up cell types and initial cells. In step, handle cell proliferation and contact inhibition.\n\nFor the plugins, perhaps in the start method, configure the VolumeEnergy parameters (lambda volume, target volume) for each cell type. Similarly, set up ContactEnergy between cell types. Also, configure Motility parameters for each cell.\n\nWait, the Volume plugin is typically configured in the XML, but maybe here they are set via the simulator. Alternatively, in the Python code, you can access the plugin objects and set their parameters.\n\nSo in the start method:\n\n- Get the volume plugin and set lambda and target volume for each cell type.\n- Get the contact plugin and set adhesion energies between cell types.\n- Get the motility plugin and set motility parameters for each cell type.\n\nBut how to access these plugins in the Python code? Let me recall. The simulator object has access to the plugin managers. For example, to configure the Volume energy:\n\nvolume_plugin = CompuCell.getConcentrationField(self.simulator, \"Volume\")\nWait, maybe it's done through the simulator object's getSteppableByType method or similar. Alternatively, perhaps using the steppable's reference to the simulator.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the parameters are set in the XML, but the user wants the Python code. So perhaps the code should include the necessary XML configuration, but the user specified to return only the Python code. Hmm, but the user said \"Generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file\" which is a .py file that includes the necessary setup. So in the Python code, they might not include the XML, but configure the plugins via the Python interface.\n\nWait, perhaps in the start method, you can set the parameters for each cell type using the simulator's plugin system.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code uses the CellTypePlugin to define cell types, and then assigns parameters via dictionaries.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the start method, after creating cells, assign their target volume, lambda volume, and other attributes.\n\nLet me think. For each cell, you can set targetVolume and lambdaVolume attributes. The Volume plugin uses these parameters. Similarly, the Contact plugin requires setting adhesion energies between cell types. The Motility plugin would set parameters like motility, persistence, etc.\n\nSo, in the start method:\n\n- Create cell types using self.cellType = self.createCellType(\"Malignant\") etc.\nWait, maybe using the cellField to create cells.\n\nWait, in CompuCell3D's Python interface, to create a cell, you can use the cellField to place a cell at a specific location. Then, set the type of the cell.\n\nThen, for each cell, assign the targetVolume, lambdaVolume, etc. These parameters are used by the Volume plugin to calculate energy.\n\nSimilarly, for motility, assign parameters like motility=30, persistenceTime=10, etc. These are used by the Motility plugin.\n\nSo, putting this together:\n\nIn the start method:\n\nmalignant_type = self.cellType(\"Malignant\")\nneuroblast_type = self.cellType(\"Neuroblast\")\n\nThen, create cells of these types. But how to define cell types? Wait, perhaps using the CellTypePlugin. Maybe the code defines cell types first.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the start method, we can directly assign the type to cells.\n\nLet me proceed step by step.\n\nThe code should start with:\n\nimport CompuCellSetup\nfrom PySteppables import SteppableBasePy\n\nThen, the simulation class:\n\nclass SimulationSteppable(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, simulator, frequency=1):\n        SteppableBasePy.__init__(self, simulator, frequency)\n\n    def start(self):\n        # Code to initialize cell types and cells\n\n    def step(self, mcs):\n        # Code for each simulation step\n\nIn the start method, create cell types. Wait, in CompuCell3D, cell types are usually defined in the XML, but perhaps in the Python script, you can create them. Alternatively, the code may use the cellTypePlugin to define types.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code can directly assign cell types by name. For example:\n\ncell = self.cellField[x, y, z]\ncell.type = self.MALIGNANT\n\nBut first, the code needs to define the cell types. Let me check. The CellTypePlugin is required, and cell types can be defined in the XML. But the user wants the code to be self-contained. So perhaps the code includes the necessary setup.\n\nWait, perhaps in the start method, the code creates the cell types by name. Then, when creating cells, assigns the type by that name.\n\nSo, in the start method:\n\nmalignant_type = self.addCellType(\"Malignant\")\nneuroblast_type = self.addCellType(\"Neuroblast\")\n\nWait, maybe that's not the correct method. Alternatively, perhaps using the cellTypePlugin:\n\ncell_type_plugin = self.getCellTypePlugin()\nmalignant_type = cell_type_plugin.addType(\"Malignant\")\nneuroblast_type = cell_type_plugin.addType(\"Neuroblast\")\n\nYes, that's likely. So in the start method, the code accesses the cell type plugin and adds the types.\n\nThen, create cells of those types.\n\nFor example, create a malignant cell at position (x,y,z):\n\ncell = self.cellField[x][y][z]\nif cell is None:\n    cell = self.potts.createCell()\n    cell.type = malignant_type\n    self.cellField[x][y][z] = cell\n\nBut to keep the example simple, perhaps just create a few cells for each type.\n\nOnce the cells are created, set their parameters:\n\ncell.targetVolume = 25\ncell.lambdaVolume = 2.0\ncell.motility = 50  # For malignant cells, higher motility\n\nSimilarly for neuroblast cells:\n\ncell.targetVolume = 20",
