      "response": "<think>\nAlright, let me tackle this. The user wants structured ontology annotations based on the provided biological description. The key points are to include Cell Ontology, Gene Ontology, and MeSH terms where applicable, following strict formatting rules.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original description. The main biological processes mentioned are gastrulation, somitogenesis, mesenchymal cells in the presomitic mesoderm, epithelialization, somite formation, and the roles of Notch, Wnt, FGF8, N-CAM, N-cadherin, EphA4, and ephrinB2.\n\nFor Cell Ontology, the text mentions mesenchymal cells and epithelialization. Mesenchymal cells would be CL:0008020 \"Mesenchymal Cell\". Epithelial cells might be CL:0000066 \"Epithelial Cell\". The presomitic mesoderm (PSM) cells are part of somitogenesis, so CL:0002322 \"Presomitic Mesoderm Cell\" seems appropriate.\n\nGene Ontology terms: Processes like somitogenesis (GO:0001756), cell adhesion (GO:0007155), and cell-cell adhesion (GO:0098609). Also, molecular functions like cadherin binding (GO:0045296) and ephrin receptor binding (GO:0046875). Notch and Wnt signaling pathways (GO:0007219 and GO:0016055), and FGF8 signaling (GO:0038108). Mesenchymal to epithelial transition (GO:0060231) is mentioned as well.\n\nMeSH terms: Gastrulation (D005769), Somites (D019170), Mesoderm (D008648), Cell Adhesion (D015815), EphrinB2 (D064128), and N-Cadherin (D019571). These are all mentioned in the text or related processes.\n\nNow, check IDs for accuracy. Ensure no spaces in IDs, correct term names. For example, \"Epithelial Cell\" not \"Epithelial\". Wait, in the example, the term was \"Epithelial\", but the correct term for CL:0000066 is \"epithelial cell\". Oh, but the user specified term names must be exact without extra spaces, so maybe they want the exact term from the ontology. Need to confirm.\n\nLooking up CL:0000066: the term is \"epithelial cell\". The user's example uses \"Epithelial\" but perhaps in the actual answer, the exact term should be used. However, the user's example shows \"Epithelial\" as the term, which might be a simplification. But since the user wants exact term names, I need to check the actual ontology. Let me verify:\n\n- CL:0008020 is \"mesenchymal cell\".\n- CL:0000066 is \"epithelial cell\".\n- CL:0002322 is \"presomitic mesoderm cell\".\n\nSo, the terms should be as per the ontology. However, the example given by the user uses \"Epithelial\" instead of \"epithelial cell\". But the user's instructions say \"Term names must be exact without extra spaces\". Therefore, perhaps the user expects the exact term as per the ontology. But the example provided by the user contradicts that. For instance, in the example, the term is \"Epithelial\" but the actual term is \"epithelial cell\". This is a conflict. The user might have made a mistake in the example. But following the user's explicit instruction, we need to use exact term names as per the ontology. So, for CL:0000066, the term is \"epithelial cell\". Similarly for others.\n\nWait, the user's example uses \"Epithelial\" as the term for CL:0000000 (which is a placeholder ID). So perhaps the user is simplifying terms. But in reality, the correct term for CL:0000066 is \"epithelial cell\". The original text mentions \"epithelialize\", so the process is mesenchymal to epithelial transition. But the cells involved are mesenchymal and epithelial cells. So in CellOntology, \"mesenchymal cell\" (CL:0008020), \"epithelial cell\" (CL:0000066), and \"presomitic mesoderm cell\" (CL:0002322).\n\nGene Ontology terms: Check the exact terms. Somitogenesis is GO:0001756, which is \"somitogenesis\". Cell adhesion is GO:0007155 \"cell adhesion\". Cell-cell adhesion is GO:0098609 \"cell-cell adhesion\". Cadherin binding is GO:0045296 \"cadherin binding\". Ephrin receptor binding is GO:0046875 \"ephrin receptor binding\". Notch signaling pathway is GO:0007219 \"Notch signaling pathway\". Wnt signaling pathway is GO:0016055 \"Wnt signaling pathway\". FGF8 is involved in FGF signaling, so GO:0038108 \"fibroblast growth factor receptor signaling pathway\". Mesenchymal to epithelial transition is GO:0060231 \"mesenchymal to epithelial transition\".\n\nMeSH terms: Gastrulation is D005769 \"Gastrulation\". Somites D019170 \"Somites\". Mesoderm D008648 \"Mesoderm\". Cell Adhesion D015815 \"Cell Adhesion\". EphrinB2 is D064128 \"Ephrin-B2\". N-Cadherin D019571 \"Cadherins\" (since N-cadherin is a type of cadherin, but MeSH might have a specific term. Alternatively, MeSH term for N-Cadherin is D019571 \"Cadherins\" as the main term, but perhaps there's a more specific one. Checking MeSH, N-Cadherin is under D019571. EphrinB2 is D064128. N-CAM is \"Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules\" D009435. Wait, the text mentions N-CAM and N-cadherin. So MeSH terms: N-CAM would be D009435 \"Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules\", N-cadherin is under D019571 \"Cadherins\". EphrinB2 is D064128 \"Ephrin-B2\". FGF8 is D050092 \"Fibroblast Growth Factor 8\".\n\nBut the user's example includes \"Cell Proliferation\" as a MeSH term. So for the original text, terms like Gastrulation, Somites, Mesoderm, Cell Adhesion, EphrinB2, N-Cadherin, N-CAM, FGF8. But MeSH terms should be exact. So:\n\n- Gastrulation: D005769\n- Somites: D019170\n- Mesoderm: D008648\n- Cell Adhesion: D015815\n- EphrinB2: D064128\n- N-Cadherin: D019571 (since that's the Cadherins term, but N-cadherin is a specific type; MeSH might have a specific entry. However, checking MeSH, \"N-Cadherin\" is indexed under Cadherins (D019571), so that's the correct term. Similarly, N-CAM is D009435 \"Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules\". FGF8 is D050092 \"Fibroblast Growth Factor 8\".\n\nBut the user's original text mentions \"adhesive N-CAM and N-cadherin and repulsive EphA4\u2013ephrinB2 pairs\". So MeSH terms for N-CAM, N-cadherin, EphA4, and ephrinB2. However, EphA4 is a receptor; MeSH term for EphA4 is D064127 \"Receptor, EphA4\", and ephrinB2 is D064128 \"Ephrin-B2\".\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nCellOntology:\n- Mesenchymal cell (CL:0008020)\n- Epithelial cell (CL:0000066)\n- Presomitic mesoderm cell (CL:0002322)\n\nGeneOntology:\n- Somitogenesis (GO:0001756)\n- Cell adhesion (GO:0007155)\n- Cell-cell adhesion (GO:0098609)\n- Cadherin binding (GO:0045296)\n- Ephrin receptor binding (GO:0046875)\n- Notch signaling pathway (GO:0007219)\n- Wnt signaling pathway (GO:0016055)\n- Fibroblast growth factor receptor signaling pathway (GO:0038108)\n- Mesenchymal to epithelial transition (GO:0060231)\n\nMeSH:\n- Gastrulation (D005769)\n- Somites (D019170)\n- Mesoderm (D008648)\n- Cell Adhesion (D015815)\n- Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules (N-CAM) (D009435)\n- Cadherins (N-cadherin) (D019571)\n- Ephrin-B2 (D064128)\n- Receptor, EphA4 (D064127)\n- Fibroblast Growth Factor 8 (D050092)\n\nNow, format these into the JSON structure as per the user's instructions. Ensure category names are exact, IDs without spaces, terms exact.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0008020\",\n            \"term\": \"mesenchymal cell\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000066\",\n            \"term\": \"epithelial cell\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0002322\",\n            \"term\": \"presomitic mesoderm cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0001756\",\n           "
