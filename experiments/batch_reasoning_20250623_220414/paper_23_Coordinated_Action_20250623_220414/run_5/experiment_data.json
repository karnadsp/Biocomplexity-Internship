In this paper, we use computer simulations of chick somitogenesis to show that experimentally-observed temporal and spatial patterns of adhesive N-CAM and N-cadherin and repulsive EphA4\u2013ephrinB2 pairs suffice to reproduce the complex dynamic morphological changes of somitogenesis in wild-type and N-cadherin (?/?) chick, including intersomitic separation, boundary-shape evolution and sorting of misdifferentiated cells across compartment boundaries. Since different models of determination yield the same, experimentally-observed, distribution of adhesion and repulsion molecules, the patterning is independent of the details of this mechanism."

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to create structured ontology annotations based on the provided biological description. They specified CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH terms, each with exact IDs and term names.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the original description. It mentions mesenchymal cells in the presomitic mesoderm (PSM), epithelialization, somitogenesis, and genes like Notch, Wnt, FGF8, N-CAM, N-cadherin, EphA4, and ephrinB2.\n\nFor CellOntology: The text talks about mesenchymal cells and epithelialization. So I need terms for mesenchymal cells and epithelial cells. Checking Cell Ontology, \"Mesenchymal Cell\" is CL:0008019 and \"Epithelial Cell\" is CL:0000066. Those should be included.\n\nGeneOntology: The processes involved include somitogenesis (GO:0001756), cell adhesion via N-CAM (GO:0007158) and N-cadherin (GO:0044331), and ephrin-Eph signaling (GO:0048013). The genes mentioned are Notch (GO:0007219) and Wnt (GO:0016055) signaling pathways. Need to map each term correctly.\n\nMeSH terms: The main concepts are Somites (D019696), Gastrulation (D020179), Cell Adhesion (D015815), and EphrinB2 (D000094066). Wait, the MeSH ID for EphrinB2 is D000094066? Let me confirm that. Also, since the paper uses computer simulations, maybe \"Models, Biological\" (D008957) should be included. The clock-and-wavefront model is part of somitogenesis models.\n\nCheck each term's ID and name for exactness. Ensure no extra spaces in IDs. For example, EphA4 is part of the Eph receptor family, but the term here is ephrin-Eph receptor signaling, so GO:0048013. MeSH term for EphrinB2 might be under ephrinB2, but the exact term is \"EphrinB2\" with ID D000094066. Also, \"Models, Biological\" is D008957.\n\nMake sure all categories are named exactly as specified: CellOntology, GeneOntology, MeSH. No typos.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CompuCell3D simulation file based on the given ontology annotations. First, I need to remember the structure of a typical CompuCell3D Python script. The user wants the code to include imports, a simulation class inheriting from SteppableBasePy, and the required methods: __init__, start, step. Also, cell types and parameters should align with the provided ontology.\n\nThe CellOntology has Epithelial and Mesenchymal cells. So I'll define those cell types. The GeneOntology terms include various signaling pathways and adhesion molecules. For the MeSH terms, EphrinB2, Somites, etc., which might relate to cell behaviors like adhesion or signaling.\n\nStarting with the imports: definitely need CompuCellSetup and steppables from PySteppables. Also, the core CompuCell modules like Cell, CellLabel, and maybe the VolumePlugin for basic volume constraints.\n\nIn the simulation class, the __init__ method should call the parent's __init__. The start method is where I'll initialize cell types and set up the initial cells. Maybe create a cluster of cells for Epithelial and Mesenchymal. The step method can handle behaviors each timestep, like adhesion strength or signaling, but the user didn't specify details, so maybe just a placeholder.\n\nFor cell parameters, adhesion molecules are important. Since there's Cell-Cell Adhesion Mediated by Cadherin, I'll set different adhesion strengths for the cell types. Maybe Epithelial has higher adhesion to stick together, while Mesenchymal might have lower. Also, volume parameters to ensure cells don't shrink or grow too much.\n\nSetting up the simulation XML with CompuCellSetup.setup, then adding steppables. The main steppable will be the simulation class. Don't forget to register the steppable with CompuCellSetup.register_steppable.\n\nWait, the Wnt, Notch, Ephrin pathways might need additional plugins. But the user didn't specify to model those dynamics, just to base parameters on the ontology. So perhaps just mention the adhesion and basic properties. Maybe include Contact plugins for adhesion between cell types. Or maybe use the Secretion plugin for signaling molecules? But without more details, keep it basic.\n\nAlso, the MeSH terms include somitogenesis and gastrulation. Maybe set up the simulation with a layout that could support somite formation, like a row of cells. But since the example is basic, perhaps just initialize a blob of cells for each type.\n\nSo, putting it all together: imports, simulation class with start method creating cells, setting adhesion and volume parameters. The step method could adjust properties over time, but perhaps just pass for now. Register the steppable and run the simulation.\n\nI need to make sure all required components are there. Check that the cell types are defined, plugins like Volume and Contact are included in the XML setup. The adhesion parameters between cell types are set in the Contact plugin. Yes, that's part of the XML configuration. So in the start method, I'll set the contact energy matrix.\n\nOkay, time to write the code.
