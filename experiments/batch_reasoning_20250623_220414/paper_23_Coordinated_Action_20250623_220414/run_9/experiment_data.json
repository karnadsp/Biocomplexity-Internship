In this paper, we use computer simulations of chick somitogenesis to show that experimentally-observed temporal and spatial patterns of adhesive N-CAM and N-cadherin and repulsive EphA4\u2013ephrinB2 pairs suffice to reproduce the complex dynamic morphological changes of somitogenesis in wild-type and N-cadherin (?/?) chick, including intersomitic separation, boundary-shape evolution and sorting of misdifferentiated cells across compartment boundaries. Since different models of determination yield the same, experimentally-observed, distribution of adhesion and repulsion molecules, the patterning is independent of the details of this mechanism."

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by breaking down the original description to identify relevant terms for each ontology category. \n\nFirst, for CellOntology, the text mentions mesenchymal cells and epithelialize. So mesenchymal cells would be under CellOntology. The process of transiently epithelialize suggests epithelial cells. Looking up Cell Ontology IDs, mesenchymal cell is CL:0008019, and epithelial cell is CL:0000066.\n\nNext, GeneOntology. The processes mentioned include somitogenesis (GO:0061053), cell fate determination (GO:0001709), cell differentiation (GO:0030154), and cell adhesion (GO:0007155). The genes Notch, Wnt, FGF8 are involved, but Gene Ontology terms are about processes, not specific genes. So terms like somitogenesis, cell fate determination, cell differentiation, and cell adhesion would fit here.\n\nFor MeSH terms, the description talks about gastrulation (D000073402), morphogenesis (D009024), and biological adhesion (D064426). These are MeSH terms related to the biological processes discussed. Checking MeSH IDs, gastrulation is D000073402, morphogenesis is D009024, and cell adhesion is D064426. \n\nNeed to ensure all IDs are correctly formatted without spaces. Also, check term names for exactness. For example, \"Epithelial\" vs. \"epithelial cell\" \u2013 the correct term is \"epithelial cell\" in Cell Ontology. Similarly, \"Mesenchymal cell\" is the precise term. \n\nWait, the user specified term names must be exact. So in the CellOntology section, the terms should be \"epithelial cell\" and \"mesenchymal cell\" as per the ontology. Similarly for GeneOntology terms like \"somitogenesis\", \"cell fate determination\", etc. \n\nDouble-checking the IDs:\n- CL:0000066 for epithelial cell\n- CL:0008019 for mesenchymal cell\n- GO:0061053 for somitogenesis\n- GO:0001709 for cell fate determination\n- GO:0030154 for cell differentiation\n- GO:0007155 for cell adhesion\n- MeSH D000073402 for gastrulation\n- D009024 for morphogenesis\n- D064426 for cell adhesion\n\nMake sure there are no typos in the IDs and that the terms match exactly what's in the respective ontologies. Also, ensure that MeSH terms are correctly capitalized, like \"Gastrulation\", \"Morphogenesis\", and \"Cell Adhesion\".\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0008019\",\n            \"term\": \"mesenchymal cell\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000066\",\n            \"term\": \"epithelial cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0061053\",\n            \"term\": \"somitogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0001709\",\n            \"term\": \"cell fate determination\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0030154\",\n            \"term\": \"cell differentiation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007155\",\n            \"term\": \"cell adhesion\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D000073402\",\n            \"term\": \"Gastrulation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D009024\",\n            \"term\": \"Morphogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D064426\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Adhesion\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"

They mentioned including required imports, a simulation class that inherits from SteppableBasePy, and the necessary methods like __init__, start, and step. Also, basic cell types and parameters based on the ontology provided.\n\nFirst, the imports. CompuCellSetup is necessary for setting up the simulation. Then, from the steppables module, I'll need SteppableBasePy. Also, some standard CC3D modules like Core, CoreInit, and Parameters. So the imports should be:\n\nimport sys\nfrom pybind import CompuCellSetup\nfrom CompuCell import Core, CoreInit, Simulator\nfrom cc3d.core.PySteppables import SteppableBasePy, Dimension\n\nNext, the simulation class. It should inherit from SteppableBasePy. The class name can be something like MorphogenesisSteppable. In the __init__ method, call the parent's __init__.\n\nIn the start method, initialize the cell types. The ontology has epithelial and mesenchymal cells. So define those types with appropriate parameters. Also, set up the lattice with maybe a cell field.\n\nThe GeneOntology terms include somitogenesis, cell fate determination, differentiation, and adhesion. MeSH terms include cell adhesion, gastrulation, morphogenesis. So the simulation should involve cell adhesion, maybe using a Contact plugin. Also, volume and surface energy constraints to model cell behavior.\n\nIn the start method, I'll need to set up the contact energy between cell types. For example, epithelial-epithelial contact energy, epithelial-mesenchymal, etc. Also, add volume and surface energy constraints using plugins like VolumeLocalFlex and SurfaceLocalFlex.\n\nIn the step method, implement basic logic for cell differentiation based on conditions. Maybe check the cell's volume and change its type if a threshold is met. That could relate to cell fate determination and differentiation.\n\nPutting it all together, the code structure would be:\n\n- Imports\n- Simulation class with __init__, start, step\n- In start, initialize cell types, contact energies, volume/surface parameters\n- In step, handle cell differentiation\n- Finally, register the steppable with CompuCellSetup.\n\nWait, also need to set up the simulation with plugins. The contact plugin is essential for adhesion. Volume and surface plugins for cell constraints. So in the start method, configure these plugins using the simulator object.\n\nCheck if the cell types are correctly defined. Use self.cellType epithelial and mesenchymal.\n\nMake sure all the required methods are present. The parameters for volume and surface might be set to 25 and 8, typical values. Contact energies would need to be set between the cell types.\n\nIn the step method, loop over each cell, check if it's epithelial and its volume exceeds a threshold, then change type to mesenchymal. That's a simple model for differentiation.\n\nFinally, register the steppable. So after the class definition, call CompuCellSetup.register_steppable and run the setup.\n\nI should also include the necessary XML configuration, but maybe the user wants all configuration in Python. Since the user didn't mention XML, I can set parameters directly via the Python API.\n\nLet me put all these elements into code. Make sure there are no syntax errors. Use proper indentation.
