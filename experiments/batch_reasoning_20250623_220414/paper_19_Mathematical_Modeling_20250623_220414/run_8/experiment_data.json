      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to create a JSON object with ontology annotations based on the provided biological modeling study. The main categories are CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH, each with their specific formatting requirements.\n\nFirst, looking at the original description. The study involves human vascular endothelial cells cultured on Matrigel, modeling their self-organization into capillary-like structures. The model uses a Cellular Potts Model and Partial Differential Equations for chemoattractant diffusion. They tested the model with and without adrenomedullin, a proangiogenic factor, and later included cell proliferation.\n\nFor CellOntology, the key cell type here is vascular endothelial cells. Checking Cell Ontology, the term should be \"vascular endothelial cell\" with ID CL:0002138. So that's one entry for CellOntology.\n\nNext, GeneOntology. The processes mentioned include cell adhesion (GO:0007155), chemotaxis (GO:0006935), cytoskeletal reorganization (GO:0007010), and cell proliferation (GO:0008283). Also, since they're talking about angiogenesis, which is part of blood vessel morphogenesis (GO:0001569), that's another GO term. Additionally, the model involves response to a chemoattractant (adrenomedullin), so maybe GO:0030335 (positive regulation of cell migration) and perhaps another term related to response to growth factors. But the description mentions chemotaxis and proliferation. The study also mentions cell proliferation experiments, so GO:0008283 is definitely needed. Cytoskeletal rearrangement would be GO:0007010. Adhesion is GO:0007155. Chemotaxis is GO:0006935. Blood vessel morphogenesis is GO:0001569. Maybe also angiogenesis (GO:0001525), but the description says proangiogenic factor adrenomedullin, so angiogenesis might be relevant here.\n\nFor MeSH terms, the study involves cell proliferation (MeSH D049109), endothelial cells (D004727), models biological (D008958), and angiogenesis (D019819). Matrigel is a extracellular matrix, so MeSH term for extracellular matrix is D005109. Also, chemotaxis (D002648) might be relevant since the model includes chemotaxis. Adrenomedullin is a peptide hormone, so D020769 for adrenomedullin.\n\nNeed to ensure all IDs are correctly formatted without spaces. Check each term's ID:\n\nCellOntology:\n- \"vascular endothelial cell\" is CL:0002138.\n\nGeneOntology:\n- Cell adhesion: GO:0007155\n- Chemotaxis: GO:0006935\n- Cytoskeletal reorganization: GO:0007010 (exact term is \"actin cytoskeleton reorganization\"? Wait, GO:0007010 is \"cytoskeleton organization\", but the study mentions cytoskeletal rearrangement. Maybe \"cytoskeleton organization\" is the broader term. Alternatively, \"cytoskeletal rearrangement\" might not be a direct term. Let me check. The exact term in GO is \"cytoskeleton organization\" (GO:0007010). The study mentions cytoskeletal rearrangement as part of the model, so GO:0007010 is appropriate.\n- Cell proliferation: GO:0008283\n- Angiogenesis: GO:0001525\n- Blood vessel morphogenesis: GO:0001569\n- Response to chemoattractant: Maybe GO:0030335 (positive regulation of cell migration) or GO:0042330 (taxis). The model includes chemotaxis, which is GO:0006935. Maybe also \"response to growth factor\" (GO:0070848) because adrenomedullin is a proangiogenic factor. But the main terms from the description are the ones listed in the model components: adhesion, cytoskeletal rearrangement, chemotaxis, and proliferation. The results relate to angiogenesis and blood vessel formation.\n\nMeSH:\n- Cell Proliferation: D049109\n- Endothelial Cells: D004727\n- Models, Biological: D008958\n- Angiogenesis: D019819\n- Extracellular Matrix: D005109 (since Matrigel is an extracellular matrix)\n- Chemotaxis: D002648\n- Adrenomedullin: D020769\n\nNeed to make sure term names are exact. For example, \"Models, Biological\" is the correct MeSH term, but the JSON requires the term without extra spaces. Wait, the example shows \"Cell Proliferation\" as a MeSH term, but in MeSH, the exact term is \"Cell Proliferation\" (D049109). Similarly, \"Endothelial Cells\" is the correct term. \"Models, Biological\" is the exact term, but the comma is part of the term. However, in the example given, the MeSH term was \"Cell Proliferation\" without a comma. So need to check if the term includes commas. For example, MeSH term for biological models is \"Models, Biological\", so the term should be exactly as per MeSH. So the entry would be {\"id\": \"D008958\", \"term\": \"Models, Biological\"}.\n\nSimilarly, \"Extracellular Matrix\" is the term for D005109. Adrenomedullin is D020769, term \"Adrenomedullin\".\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nCellOntology: [{\"id\": \"CL:0002138\", \"term\": \"vascular endothelial cell\"}]\n\nGeneOntology: [\n  {\"id\": \"GO:0007155\", \"term\": \"cell adhesion\"},\n  {\"id\": \"GO:0006935\", \"term\": \"chemotaxis\"},\n  {\"id\": \"GO:0007010\", \"term\": \"cytoskeleton organization\"},\n  {\"id\": \"GO:0008283\", \"term\": \"cell proliferation\"},\n  {\"id\": \"GO:0001569\", \"term\": \"blood vessel morphogenesis\"},\n  {\"id\": \"GO:0001525\", \"term\": \"angiogenesis\"}\n]\n\nMeSH: [\n  {\"id\": \"D049109\", \"term\": \"Cell Proliferation\"},\n  {\"id\": \"D004727\", \"term\": \"Endothelial Cells\"},\n  {\"id\": \"D008958\", \"term\": \"Models, Biological\"},\n  {\"id\": \"D019819\", \"term\": \"Angiogenesis\"},\n  {\"id\": \"D005109\", \"term\": \"Extracellular Matrix\"},\n  {\"id\": \"D002648\", \"term\": \"Chemotaxis\"},\n  {\"id\": \"D020769\", \"term\": \"Adrenomedullin\"}\n]\n\nCheck if all terms are correctly capitalized. For example, \"cell adhesion\" in GO is lowercase, as per GO terms. MeSH terms are in title case. So for GeneOntology, terms are lowercase except proper nouns. For example, \"blood vessel morphogenesis\" is lowercase. Correct. MeSH terms are as per their entries, e.g., \"Cell Proliferation\", \"Endothelial Cells\", \"Models, Biological\", etc.\n\nAlso, ensure no extra spaces in terms or IDs. All IDs are correctly formatted without spaces.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0002138\",\n            \"term\": \"vascular endothelial cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007155\",\n            \"term\": \"cell adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0006935\",\n            \"term\": \"chemotaxis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007010\",\n            \"term\": \"cytoskeleton organization\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0008283\",\n            \"term\": \"cell proliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0001569\",\n            \"term\": \"blood vessel morphogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0001525\",\n            \"term\": \"angiogenesis\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D049109\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Proliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D004727\",\n            \"term\": \"Endothelial Cells\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D008958\",\n            \"term\": \"Models, Biological\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D019819\",\n            \"term\": \"Angiogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D005109\",\n            \"term\": \"Extracellular Matrix\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002648\",\n            \"term\": \"Chemotaxis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D020769\",\n            \"term\": \"Adrenomedullin\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"

Basic cell types and parameters based on the ontology annotations",
      "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation Python file based on the provided ontology annotations. Let me start by recalling the structure of a typical CompuCell3D script.\n\nFirst, the necessary imports: CompuCellSetup and the steppables module. That's straightforward. Then, a simulation class that inherits from steppables.SteppableBasePy. The class should have __init__, start, and step methods.\n\nLooking at the ontology annotations, the cell type is vascular endothelial cells. The GeneOntology terms include cytoskeleton organization, cell adhesion, blood vessel morphogenesis, angiogenesis, chemotaxis, and cell proliferation. MeSH terms mention Biological Models, Adrenomedullin, Chemotaxis, Angiogenesis, Endothelial Cells, Extracellular Matrix, and Cell Proliferation.\n\nSo, the simulation should model endothelial cells with parameters related to adhesion, proliferation, chemotaxis (maybe towards Adrenomedullin), and interactions with the extracellular matrix. \n\nIn the start method, I'll set up the cell type. For parameters, adhesion energy, chemotaxis parameters, and proliferation rate. The step method can handle cell division and chemotaxis. Also, maybe adjust cell target volume and adhesion each step.\n\nWait, the CompuCell3D setup requires defining the simulation dimensions, cell types, and plugins. So, in the start method, I need to initialize the cell type with the appropriate parameters. The step method will run every MCS; perhaps check for cell division conditions and apply chemotaxis towards a chemical field.\n\nNeed to include the chemotaxis plugin. So in the XML part (but since the user wants Python code, maybe using the FlexibleDiffusionSolverFE?). Or perhaps the user expects the Python code to include the setup for chemotaxis via the steppable.\n\nWait, the code must be in Python, so perhaps using the MitosisSteppable for cell division. But the user specified to include required methods (__init__, start, step), so maybe handling division manually in the step method.\n\nLet me outline the code structure:\n\n- Imports: CompuCellSetup, steppables, and maybe some other modules like cc3d or PySteppables.\n- The simulation class inherits from SteppableBasePy.\n- In __init__, call the parent constructor.\n- In start, define the cell type (vascular_endothelial), set adhesion parameters, maybe set up a chemical field (Adrenomedullin) using a solver, and configure chemotaxis.\n- In step, handle cell division (proliferation) and apply chemotaxis each step.\n\nAlso, need to set up the extracellular matrix (ECM), perhaps as a medium cell type or a separate field. But the MeSH term includes ECM, so maybe including interactions between cells and ECM.\n\nFor chemotaxis, cells should move towards higher concentrations of Adrenomedullin. So, set up a diffusion solver for Adrenomedullin and configure the chemotaxis parameters in the steppable.\n\nPutting it all together, the code would import necessary modules, define the simulation class with start and step methods, set up cell types with adhesion and chemotaxis, handle proliferation in step, and configure the diffusion and chemotaxis.\n\nI need to make sure all the parameters from the ontology are addressed: adhesion (cell adhesion GO term), chemotaxis (chemotaxis GO and MeSH), proliferation (cell proliferation GO), and morphogenesis/angiogenesis through cell behaviors.\n\nAlso, include the simulation dimensions and necessary plugins (like VolumePlugin, ContactPlugin, ChemotaxisPlugin, etc.) via the XML or through the Python code. Since the user wants the Python code, perhaps the XML configuration is handled implicitly, but in the code, I should set up the sim parameters.\n\nWait, in CompuCell3D, the Python script usually configures the simulation via the XML. So perhaps in the start method, I need to register the adhesion energy, setup the diffusion field, and enable chemotaxis.\n\nLet me draft the code step by step.\n\nStart with imports:\n\nfrom cc3d.core.PyCoreSpecs import *\nimport cc3d.CompuCellSetup as CompuCellSetup\n\nThen define the simulation class:\n\nclass VascularEndothelialSim(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, *args):\n        super().__init__(*args)\n    \n    def start(self):\n        # Set up cell type, adhesion, chemotaxis, ECM interactions\n        self.cell_type = self.create_cell_type(\"VascularEndothelial\", \"vascular endothelial cell (CL:0002138)\")\n        # Adhesion parameters: set contact energy between cells and medium\n        self.set_contact_energy(self.cell_type, \"Medium\", 10)\n        # Set up Adrenomedullin field and chemotaxis\n        adrenomedullin_field = self.create_field(\"Adrenomedullin\", \"DiffusionField\")\n        self.add_chemotaxis_data(self.cell_type, adrenomedullin_field, lambda_chemo=100)\n        # Set proliferation parameters\n        self.proliferation_rate = 0.1\n    \n    def step(self, mcs):\n        # Handle cell division based on proliferation rate\n        for cell in self.cell_list:\n            if cell.type == self.cell_type:\n                if mcs % 10 == 0 and random.random() < self.proliferation_rate:\n                    self.divide_cell_random_orientation(cell)\n        # Update chemotaxis each step if needed\n\nWait, but some of these methods might not be directly available. Need to use the proper CC3D Python API.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the built-in specs for contact, chemotaxis, and volume.\n\nWait, maybe the code should use the specs approach as per the newer CC3D versions.\n\nLet me adjust. The imports would include the necessary specs, then build a simulation specification.\n\nBut the user wants the code to include a simulation class that inherits from SteppableBasePy. So perhaps the code uses the traditional approach with steppables.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects the older style of CC3D scripts.\n\nLet me try to write a standard script with the required elements.\n\nThe code:\n\nfrom cc3d import CompuCellSetup\nfrom cc3d.core.PySteppables import *\n\nclass VascularEndothelialSim(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, frequency=1):\n        super().__init__(frequency)\n        self.vascular_endothelial_type = None\n        self.adrenomedullin_field = None\n\n    def start(self):\n        # Define cell types\n        self.vascular_endothelial_type = self.new_cell_type(\"VascularEndothelial\")\n        # Set contact energy\n        self.cell_field.set_contact_energy(self.vascular_endothelial_type, self.MEDIUM, 10)\n        # Setup Adrenomedullin field and chemotaxis\n        self.adrenomedullin_field = self.create_scalar_field_cell_level(\"Adrenomedullin\")\n        self.add_chemotaxis_data(self.vascular_endothelial_type, self.adrenomedullin_field, 100)\n        # Initial cell setup\n        cell = self.potts.createCell()\n        cell.type = self.vascular_endothelial_type\n        self.cell_field[0,0,0] = cell\n        # Set volume parameters\n        self.build_cell_volume_plugin(self.vascular_endothelial_type, target_volume=25, lambda_volume=2.0)\n        # Proliferation rate\n        self.proliferation_rate = 0.05\n\n    def step(self, mcs):\n        # Proliferation\n        for cell in self.cell_list:\n            if cell.type == self.vascular_endothelial_type and mcs % 10 == 0:\n                if np.random.rand() < self.proliferation_rate:\n                    self.divide_cell_orientation_vector_based(cell, 1, 0, 0)\n        # Chemotaxis and other updates\n        # Update Adrenomedullin field (example diffusion step, but need a solver)\n        # For simplicity, maybe omit solver setup here or include basic setup\n\nBut wait, the code might need to set up the diffusion solver for Adrenomedullin. That's typically done via XML or using the specs. Since the user wants Python code, perhaps using the specs.\n\nAlternatively, the code may need to include the setup for diffusion and chemotaxis.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to include the necessary specs for diffusion and chemotaxis.\n\nLet me adjust:\n\nfrom cc3d.core.PyCoreSpecs import *\nimport cc3d.CompuCellSetup as CompuCellSetup\n\n# Create core specification\nspecs = CoreSpecification()\nspecs.dimensions = (100, 100, 1)\n\n# Cell types\ncell_type = CellTypePlugin(\"VascularEndothelial\")\ncell_type.volume = 25\ncell_type.lambda_volume = 2.0\n\n# Contact energy\ncontact = ContactPlugin()\ncontact.set_energy(\"VascularEndothelial\", \"Medium\", 10)\n\n# Adrenomedullin diffusion\nadrenomedullin = DiffusionSolverFE()\nadrenomedullin.field_name = \"Adrenomedullin\"\nadrenomedullin.diffusion_constant = 0.1\nadrenomedullin.decay_constant = 0.01\nadrenomedullin.initial_condition = 0.0\n\n# Chemot"

Check each term's ID:\n\nCellOntology:\n- \"vascular endothelial cell\" is CL:0002138.\n\nGeneOntology:\n- Cell adhesion: GO:0007155\n- Chemotaxis: GO:0006935\n- Cytoskeletal reorganization: GO:0007010 (exact term is \"actin cytoskeleton reorganization\"? Wait, GO:0007010 is \"cytoskeleton organization\", but the study mentions cytoskeletal rearrangement. Maybe \"cytoskeleton organization\" is the broader term. Alternatively, \"cytoskeletal rearrangement\" might not be a direct term. Let me check. The exact term in GO is \"cytoskeleton organization\" (GO:0007010). The study mentions cytoskeletal rearrangement as part of the model, so GO:0007010 is appropriate.\n- Cell proliferation: GO:0008283\n- Angiogenesis: GO:0001525\n- Blood vessel morphogenesis: GO:0001569\n- Response to chemoattractant: Maybe GO:0030335 (positive regulation of cell migration) or GO:0042330 (taxis). The model includes chemotaxis, which is GO:0006935. Maybe also \"response to growth factor\" (GO:0070848) because adrenomedullin is a proangiogenic factor. But the main terms from the description are the ones listed in the model components: adhesion, cytoskeletal rearrangement, chemotaxis, and proliferation. The results relate to angiogenesis and blood vessel formation.\n\nMeSH:\n- Cell Proliferation: D049109\n- Endothelial Cells: D004727\n- Models, Biological: D008958\n- Angiogenesis: D019819\n- Extracellular Matrix: D005109 (since Matrigel is an extracellular matrix)\n- Chemotaxis: D002648\n- Adrenomedullin: D020769\n\nNeed to make sure term names are exact. For example, \"Models, Biological\" is the correct MeSH term, but the JSON requires the term without extra spaces. Wait, the example shows \"Cell Proliferation\" as a MeSH term, but in MeSH, the exact term is \"Cell Proliferation\" (D049109). Similarly, \"Endothelial Cells\" is the correct term. \"Models, Biological\" is the exact term, but the comma is part of the term. However, in the example given, the MeSH term was \"Cell Proliferation\" without a comma. So need to check if the term includes commas. For example, MeSH term for biological models is \"Models, Biological\", so the term should be exactly as per MeSH. So the entry would be {\"id\": \"D008958\", \"term\": \"Models, Biological\"}.\n\nSimilarly, \"Extracellular Matrix\" is the term for D005109. Adrenomedullin is D020769, term \"Adrenomedullin\".\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nCellOntology: [{\"id\": \"CL:0002138\", \"term\": \"vascular endothelial cell\"}]\n\nGeneOntology: [\n  {\"id\": \"GO:0007155\", \"term\": \"cell adhesion\"},\n  {\"id\": \"GO:0006935\", \"term\": \"chemotaxis\"},\n  {\"id\": \"GO:0007010\", \"term\": \"cytoskeleton organization\"},\n  {\"id\": \"GO:0008283\", \"term\": \"cell proliferation\"},\n  {\"id\": \"GO:0001569\", \"term\": \"blood vessel morphogenesis\"},\n  {\"id\": \"GO:0001525\", \"term\": \"angiogenesis\"}\n]\n\nMeSH: [\n  {\"id\": \"D049109\", \"term\": \"Cell Proliferation\"},\n  {\"id\": \"D004727\", \"term\": \"Endothelial Cells\"},\n  {\"id\": \"D008958\", \"term\": \"Models, Biological\"},\n  {\"id\": \"D019819\", \"term\": \"Angiogenesis\"},\n  {\"id\": \"D005109\", \"term\": \"Extracellular Matrix\"},\n  {\"id\": \"D002648\", \"term\": \"Chemotaxis\"},\n  {\"id\": \"D020769\", \"term\": \"Adrenomedullin\"}\n]\n\nCheck if all terms are correctly capitalized. For example, \"cell adhesion\" in GO is lowercase, as per GO terms. MeSH terms are in title case. So for GeneOntology, terms are lowercase except proper nouns. For example, \"blood vessel morphogenesis\" is lowercase. Correct. MeSH terms are as per their entries, e.g., \"Cell Proliferation\", \"Endothelial Cells\", \"Models, Biological\", etc.\n\nAlso, ensure no extra spaces in terms or IDs. All IDs are correctly formatted without spaces.\n</think>",

      "python_code": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation Python file based on the provided ontology annotations. Let me start by recalling the structure of a typical CompuCell3D script.\n\nFirst, the necessary imports: CompuCellSetup and the steppables module. That's straightforward. Then, a simulation class that inherits from steppables.SteppableBasePy. The class should have __init__, start, and step methods.\n\nLooking at the ontology annotations, the cell type is vascular endothelial cells. The GeneOntology terms include cytoskeleton organization, cell adhesion, blood vessel morphogenesis, angiogenesis, chemotaxis, and cell proliferation. MeSH terms mention Biological Models, Adrenomedullin, Chemotaxis, Angiogenesis, Endothelial Cells, Extracellular Matrix, and Cell Proliferation.\n\nSo, the simulation should model endothelial cells with parameters related to adhesion, proliferation, chemotaxis (maybe towards Adrenomedullin), and interactions with the extracellular matrix. \n\nIn the start method, I'll set up the cell type. For parameters, adhesion energy, chemotaxis parameters, and proliferation rate. The step method can handle cell division and chemotaxis. Also, maybe adjust cell target volume and adhesion each step.\n\nWait, the CompuCell3D setup requires defining the simulation dimensions, cell types, and plugins. So, in the start method, I need to initialize the cell type with the appropriate parameters. The step method will run every MCS; perhaps check for cell division conditions and apply chemotaxis towards a chemical field.\n\nNeed to include the chemotaxis plugin. So in the XML part (but since the user wants Python code, maybe using the FlexibleDiffusionSolverFE?). Or perhaps the user expects the Python code to include the setup for chemotaxis via the steppable.\n\nWait, the code must be in Python, so perhaps using the MitosisSteppable for cell division. But the user specified to include required methods (__init__, start, step), so maybe handling division manually in the step method.\n\nLet me outline the code structure:\n\n- Imports: CompuCellSetup, steppables, and maybe some other modules like cc3d or PySteppables.\n- The simulation class inherits from SteppableBasePy.\n- In __init__, call the parent constructor.\n- In start, define the cell type (vascular_endothelial), set adhesion parameters, maybe set up a chemical field (Adrenomedullin) using a solver, and configure chemotaxis.\n- In step, handle cell division (proliferation) and apply chemotaxis each step.\n\nAlso, need to set up the extracellular matrix (ECM), perhaps as a medium cell type or a separate field. But the MeSH term includes ECM, so maybe including interactions between cells and ECM.\n\nFor chemotaxis, cells should move towards higher concentrations of Adrenomedullin. So, set up a diffusion solver for Adrenomedullin and configure the chemotaxis parameters in the steppable.\n\nPutting it all together, the code would import necessary modules, define the simulation class with start and step methods, set up cell types with adhesion and chemotaxis, handle proliferation in step, and configure the diffusion and chemotaxis.\n\nI need to make sure all the parameters from the ontology are addressed: adhesion (cell adhesion GO term), chemotaxis (chemotaxis GO and MeSH), proliferation (cell proliferation GO), and morphogenesis/angiogenesis through cell behaviors.\n\nAlso, include the simulation dimensions and necessary plugins (like VolumePlugin, ContactPlugin, ChemotaxisPlugin, etc.) via the XML or through the Python code. Since the user wants the Python code, perhaps the XML configuration is handled implicitly, but in the code, I should set up the sim parameters.\n\nWait, in CompuCell3D, the Python script usually configures the simulation via the XML. So perhaps in the start method, I need to register the adhesion energy, setup the diffusion field, and enable chemotaxis.\n\nLet me draft the code step by step.\n\nStart with imports:\n\nfrom cc3d.core.PyCoreSpecs import *\nimport cc3d.CompuCellSetup as CompuCellSetup\n\nThen define the simulation class:\n\nclass VascularEndothelialSim(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, *args):\n        super().__init__(*args)\n    \n    def start(self):\n        # Set up cell type, adhesion, chemotaxis, ECM interactions\n        self.cell_type = self.create_cell_type(\"VascularEndothelial\", \"vascular endothelial cell (CL:0002138)\")\n        # Adhesion parameters: set contact energy between cells and medium\n        self.set_contact_energy(self.cell_type, \"Medium\", 10)\n        # Set up Adrenomedullin field and chemotaxis\n        adrenomedullin_field = self.create_field(\"Adrenomedullin\", \"DiffusionField\")\n        self.add_chemotaxis_data(self.cell_type, adrenomedullin_field, lambda_chemo=100)\n        # Set proliferation parameters\n        self.proliferation_rate = 0.1\n    \n    def step(self, mcs):\n        # Handle cell division based on proliferation rate\n        for cell in self.cell_list:\n            if cell.type == self.cell_type:\n                if mcs % 10 == 0 and random.random() < self.proliferation_rate:\n                    self.divide_cell_random_orientation(cell)\n        # Update chemotaxis each step if needed\n\nWait, but some of these methods might not be directly available. Need to use the proper CC3D Python API.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the built-in specs for contact, chemotaxis, and volume.\n\nWait, maybe the code should use the specs approach as per the newer CC3D versions.\n\nLet me adjust. The imports would include the necessary specs, then build a simulation specification.\n\nBut the user wants the code to include a simulation class that inherits from SteppableBasePy. So perhaps the code uses the traditional approach with steppables.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects the older style of CC3D scripts.\n\nLet me try to write a standard script with the required elements.\n\nThe code:\n\nfrom cc3d import CompuCellSetup\nfrom cc3d.core.PySteppables import *\n\nclass VascularEndothelialSim(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, frequency=1):\n        super().__init__(frequency)\n        self.vascular_endothelial_type = None\n        self.adrenomedullin_field = None\n\n    def start(self):\n        # Define cell types\n        self.vascular_endothelial_type = self.new_cell_type(\"VascularEndothelial\")\n        # Set contact energy\n        self.cell_field.set_contact_energy(self.vascular_endothelial_type, self.MEDIUM, 10)\n        # Setup Adrenomedullin field and chemotaxis\n        self.adrenomedullin_field = self.create_scalar_field_cell_level(\"Adrenomedullin\")\n        self.add_chemotaxis_data(self.vascular_endothelial_type, self.adrenomedullin_field, 100)\n        # Initial cell setup\n        cell = self.potts.createCell()\n        cell.type = self.vascular_endothelial_type\n        self.cell_field[0,0,0] = cell\n        # Set volume parameters\n        self.build_cell_volume_plugin(self.vascular_endothelial_type, target_volume=25, lambda_volume=2.0)\n        # Proliferation rate\n        self.proliferation_rate = 0.05\n\n    def step(self, mcs):\n        # Proliferation\n        for cell in self.cell_list:\n            if cell.type == self.vascular_endothelial_type and mcs % 10 == 0:\n                if np.random.rand() < self.proliferation_rate:\n                    self.divide_cell_orientation_vector_based(cell, 1, 0, 0)\n        # Chemotaxis and other updates\n        # Update Adrenomedullin field (example diffusion step, but need a solver)\n        # For simplicity, maybe omit solver setup here or include basic setup\n\nBut wait, the code might need to set up the diffusion solver for Adrenomedullin. That's typically done via XML or using the specs. Since the user wants Python code, perhaps using the specs.\n\nAlternatively, the code may need to include the setup for diffusion and chemotaxis.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to include the necessary specs for diffusion and chemotaxis.\n\nLet me adjust:\n\nfrom cc3d.core.PyCoreSpecs import *\nimport cc3d.CompuCellSetup as CompuCellSetup\n\n# Create core specification\nspecs = CoreSpecification()\nspecs.dimensions = (100, 100, 1)\n\n# Cell types\ncell_type = CellTypePlugin(\"VascularEndothelial\")\ncell_type.volume = 25\ncell_type.lambda_volume = 2.0\n\n# Contact energy\ncontact = ContactPlugin()\ncontact.set_energy(\"VascularEndothelial\", \"Medium\", 10)\n\n# Adrenomedullin diffusion\nadrenomedullin = DiffusionSolverFE()\nadrenomedullin.field_name = \"Adrenomedullin\"\nadrenomedullin.diffusion_constant = 0.1\nadrenomedullin.decay_constant = 0.01\nadrenomedullin.initial_condition = 0.0\n\n# Chemot",
