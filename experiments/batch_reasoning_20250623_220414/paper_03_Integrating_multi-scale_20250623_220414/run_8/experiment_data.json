      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by analyzing the original description to identify relevant terms for each ontology. The text discusses heart development, specifically trabeculation involving endocardial and myocardial cells. \n\nFor Cell Ontology (CellOntology), the key cell types mentioned are endocardial and myocardial cells. I'll need to find the correct CL IDs for these. Endocardial cells are likely CL:0002218, and myocardial cells are CL:0000746.\n\nNext, Gene Ontology (GeneOntology) terms. The process involves cell-cell interactions and tissue-specific cell behavior. Relevant GO terms might be \"cell-cell signaling\" (GO:0007267), \"cell morphogenesis involved in differentiation\" (GO:0000904), and \"heart development\" (GO:0007507).\n\nFor MeSH terms, topics like heart development (D006321) and systems biology (D058116) are mentioned. Also, cell proliferation (D049928) is relevant as trabeculation involves cell behavior and growth.\n\nI need to ensure the IDs are correctly formatted without spaces and terms are exact. Double-check each ID against the respective ontology databases to confirm accuracy. Make sure category names are as specified and no extra spaces in terms.
