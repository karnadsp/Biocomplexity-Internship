      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by breaking down the original description. The study is about somite formation in vertebrate embryos, challenging the traditional clock-and-wavefront model. They mention that treating non-somite mesoderm with Noggin leads to simultaneous somite formation without cyclic Notch-pathway gene expression. The somites formed are normal in size, shape, and fate, have axial identity determined by Hox code, but lack rostral-caudal subdivision affecting neural segmentation.\n\nFirst, for Cell Ontology (CellOntology), the key cell types here are somites and non-somite mesoderm. So I need to find the exact CL terms. \"Somite\" is likely CL:0002322, which is the correct ID. \"Mesoderm\" would be CL:0000223, but since it's non-somite mesoderm, maybe CL:0002328 (mesodermal cell)? Wait, let me verify. CL:0002328 is \"mesodermal cell\", which might be more general. Alternatively, if there's a specific term for non-somite mesoderm, but I don't recall one. Maybe stick with mesoderm. Hmm, the study refers to \"non-somite mesoderm\", so perhaps using the general mesoderm term is appropriate here.\n\nNext, Gene Ontology (GeneOntology). The processes mentioned include somite formation (GO:0061053), segmentation (GO:0035282), and cell-cell signaling (GO:0007267). The Notch pathway is involved, so Notch signaling pathway (GO:0007219). Also, axial specification (GO:0009952) because of the Hox code determining axial identity. Self-organizing structures might relate to pattern specification (GO:0007389). The lack of rostral-caudal subdivision could relate to segmentation, but since they didn't subdivide, maybe it's the absence of that process. But the presence of normal segmentation except for the subdivision? The GO terms should reflect the processes that are present. So somite formation, segmentation, cell-cell signaling, Notch pathway, axial specification, and maybe embryonic pattern specification.\n\nFor MeSH terms, the topics here include somites (D019642), mesoderm (D008647), embryonic development (D047108), and biological clocks (D064706) since the segmentation clock is discussed. Also, cell communication (D016020) for the local cell-cell interactions mentioned. Noggin is a protein, so MeSH term for Noggin (D050097). Hox genes would be under \"Homeodomain Proteins\" (D006757) or \"Genes, Homeobox\" (D015851). Since the Hox code is mentioned, probably D015851. Self-organization in biology is D054577.\n\nWait, checking MeSH terms: \"Noggin\" is a specific protein, so D050097. \"Hox Genes\" are under \"Genes, Homeobox\" (D015851). \"Biological Clocks\" is D001677, but the segmentation clock might be under D064706? Let me confirm. MeSH term D064706 is \"Biological Clocks\", which is correct. \"Self-organizing systems\" in biology is D054577. \"Cell Communication\" is D016020. \"Embryonic Development\" is D047108. \"Mesoderm\" is D008647. \"Somites\" is D019642.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nCellOntology: Somite (CL:0002322), Mesodermal cell (CL:0000223? Or CL:0002328). Wait, CL:0000223 is \"mesodermal cell\", yes. So non-somite mesoderm would be part of mesodermal cells. The study mentions \"non-somite mesoderm treated with Noggin\", so mesodermal cell is appropriate here.\n\nGeneOntology: Somite formation (GO:0061053), segmentation (GO:0035282), cell-cell signaling (GO:0007267), Notch signaling pathway (GO:0007219), embryonic pattern specification (GO:0007389), axial specification (GO:0009952). Maybe also Hox gene involved in anterior/posterior axis specification (GO:0009952 is correct). Also, the self-organization aspect might relate to \"anatomical structure arrangement\" (GO:0048532), but GO:0007389 is \"pattern specification process\", which seems more relevant.\n\nMeSH: Somites (D019642), Mesoderm (D008647), Embryonic Development (D047108), Biological Clocks (D064706), Cell Communication (D016020), Noggin (D050097), Genes, Homeobox (D015851), Self-organizing systems (D054577).\n\nDouble-check all IDs for correctness. CL:0002322 is indeed \"somite\". CL:0000223 is \"mesodermal cell\". For Gene Ontology, the terms seem correct. MeSH terms: D050097 for Noggin, D015851 for Hox genes. D054577 for self-organizing systems. Yes.\n\nNow, structure the JSON exactly as per the example, with the correct categories, exact IDs, and terms without extra spaces. Make sure each term is present once. For example, \"Somite\" in CellOntology, \"Mesoderm\" in MeSH. Also, check if \"self-organizing structures\" in the original text would map to MeSH's \"Self-organizing systems\" (D054577). Yes.\n\nSo the final JSON should include all these terms under their respective categories without any explanations.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0002322\",\n            \"term\": \"Somite\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000223\",\n            \"term\": \"Mesodermal\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0061053\",\n            \"term\": \"SomiteFormation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0035282\",\n            \"term\": \"Segmentation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007267\",\n            \"term\": \"CellCellSignaling\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007219\",\n            \"term\": \"NotchSignalingPathway\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007389\",\n            \"term\": \"PatternSpecification\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0009952\",\n            \"term\": \"AnteriorPosteriorPatternFormation\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D019642\",\n            \"term\": \"Somites\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D008647\",\n            \"term\": \"Mesoderm\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D047108\",\n            \"term\": \"EmbryonicDevelopment\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D064706\",\n            \"term\": \"BiologicalClocks\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D016020\",\n            \"term\": \"CellCommunication\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D050097\",\n            \"term\": \"Noggin\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D015851\",\n            \"term\": \"HomeoboxGenes\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D054577\",\n            \"term\": \"SelfOrganization\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```"
