Here we show that a clock-and-wavefront mechanism is unnecessary for somite formation. Non-somite mesoderm treated with Noggin generates many somites that form simultaneously, without cyclic expression of Notch-pathway genes, yet have normal size, shape, and fate. These somites have axial identity: The Hox code is fixed independently of somite fate. However, these somites are not subdivided into rostral and caudal halves, which is necessary for neural segmentation. We propose that somites are self-organizing structures whose size and shape is controlled by local cell-cell interactions."

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a JSON object with ontology annotations based on the provided information. Let's start by parsing the original description and identifying relevant terms for each ontology category: CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH.\n\nFirst, looking at CellOntology. The text mentions \"somites\" several times. I remember that somites are structures in developing embryos, so I should check the Cell Ontology for the correct term and ID. The CL term for somite is \"CL:0002322\" with the term \"Somite\". That's one entry for CellOntology.\n\nNext, GeneOntology. The text discusses processes like \"molecular oscillations\", \"segmentation clock\", \"cell-cell interactions\", and \"somite formation\". For molecular oscillations, the GO term might be \"GO:0042752\" which is \"regulation of circadian rhythm\". The segmentation clock is a key concept here, so \"segmentation clock\" itself is a GO term with ID \"GO:0042733\". Cell-cell interactions would correspond to \"cell-cell adhesion\" which is \"GO:0098609\". Somite formation is \"somitogenesis\" with GO:0001756. Also mentioned is \"neural segmentation\", which I think is covered by \"neural tube formation\", maybe \"GO:0021915\" for \"neural tube closure\". Hox code refers to Hox genes, so \"anterior/posterior pattern specification\" as \"GO:0009952\".\n\nFor MeSH terms, the main topics are \"Somites\", which is MeSH D013026. \"Embryonic Development\" is D004626. \"Cell Communication\" is D002467. \"Body Patterning\" is D001826, and \"Hox Genes\" would be under D015380. \n\nI need to ensure all IDs are correctly formatted without spaces and terms are exact. Let me double-check each term's ID and name. \n\nCellOntology: Somite is CL:0002322. Correct.\n\nGeneOntology entries:\n- Regulation of circadian rhythm (GO:0042752) is correct, but the text mentions molecular oscillations in segmentation clock. Maybe \"segmentation clock\" (GO:0042733) is better. \n- Segmentation clock (GO:0042733) is accurate.\n- Cell-cell adhesion (GO:0098609) matches \"local cell-cell interactions\".\n- Somitogenesis (GO:0001756) for somite formation.\n- Anterior/posterior pattern specification (GO:0009952) for Hox code.\n- Neural tube closure (GO:0021915) for neural segmentation.\n\nMeSH:\n- Somites (D013026)\n- Embryonic Development (D004626)\n- Cell Communication (D002467)\n- Body Patterning (D001826)\n- Hox Genes (D015380)\n\nI think that covers all the relevant terms. Let me structure the JSON accordingly, making sure each category has the correct name and entries are properly formatted.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0002322\",\n            \"term\": \"Somite\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0042733\",\n            \"term\": \"segmentation clock\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0098609\",\n            \"term\": \"cell-cell adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0001756\",\n            \"term\": \"somitogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0021915\",\n            \"term\": \"neural tube closure\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0009952\",\n            \"term\": \"anterior/posterior pattern specification\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D013026\",\n            \"term\": \"Somites\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D004626\",\n            \"term\": \"Embryonic Development\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002467\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Communication\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D001826\",\n            \"term\": \"Body Patterning\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D015380\",\n            \"term\": \"Hox Genes\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"

Also, it needs to incorporate the given ontology annotations.\n\nFirst, the necessary imports. CompuCellSetup is needed to set up the simulation.

The start method is where the simulation setup happens\u2014like initializing cell types and fields.

MeSH terms like Hox Genes and Body Patterning might influence cell properties or differentiation rules.\n\nIn the start method, I'll define the cell types using the CellTypePlugin.
