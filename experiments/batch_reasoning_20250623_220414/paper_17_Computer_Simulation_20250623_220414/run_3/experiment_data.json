This process of cell movements organizes the ommatidial array into a functional pattern. Unlike earlier simulations that focused on the arrangements of cells within individual ommatidia, here we examine the local movements that lead to large-scale organization of the emerging eye field. Simulations based on our experimental observations of cell adhesion, cell death, and cell movement successfully patterned a tracing of an emerging wild-type pupal eye. Surprisingly, altering cell adhesion had only a mild effect on patterning, contradicting our previous hypothesis that the patterning was primarily the result of referential adhesion between IRMclass surface proteins. Instead, our simulations highlighted the importance of programmed cell death (PCD) as well as a previously unappreciated variable: the expansion of cells\u2019 apical surface areas, which promoted rearrangement of neighboring cells. We tested this prediction experimentally by preventing expansion in the apical area of individual cells: patterning was disrupted in a manner predicted by our simulations. Our work demonstrates the value of combining computer simulation with in vivo experiments to uncover novel mechanisms that are perpetuated throughout the eye field. It also demonstrates the utility of the Glazier\u2013Graner\u2013Hogeweg model (GGH) for modeling the links between local cellular interactions and emergent properties of developing epithelia as well as predicting unanticipated results in vivo."

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants a JSON object with ontology annotations based on the provided biological description. The categories must be exact: CellOntology, GeneOntology, MeSH. \n\nFirst, I'll look for cell types mentioned. The text talks about \"glial-like support cells\" in the Drosophila pupal eye. Cell Ontology terms... maybe \"glial cell\" \u2013 check the CL ID. CL:0000122 is for glial cells.\n\nNext, processes involved: cell adhesion, cell death (apoptosis), cell movement. For Gene Ontology, cell adhesion is GO:0007155, programmed cell death is GO:0012501, cell motility is GO:0016477. Also, there's mention of apical surface area expansion. Apical part of cell is GO:0045177, and cell morphogenesis could be GO:0000902.\n\nFor MeSH terms, the study involves computer simulation, so \"Computer Simulation\" is D003198. Drosophila is a model organism, so \"Drosophila melanogaster\" D004305. Programmed cell death is MeSH D017209. Epithelium development \u2013 \"Epithelium\" is D004848, but maybe \"Epithelial Cells\" D004848. Wait, D004848 is Epithelial Cells. Also, cell adhesion in MeSH is D015815. \n\nCheck all IDs for accuracy. Make sure no spaces in IDs. Terms should match exactly. Let's compile each category. \n\nCellOntology: glial cells (CL:0000122). GeneOntology includes cell adhesion, programmed cell death, cell motility, apical part of cell, cell morphogenesis. MeSH entries: Computer Simulation, Drosophila melanogaster, Epithelial Cells, Programmed Cell Death, Cell Adhesion.\n\nEnsure no extra spaces in terms. Double-check each ID against the ontologies.

ProgrammedCellDeath could be a parameter like deathRate, which could be checked during each step to see if the cell dies.\n\nIn the step method, I can implement cell death by checking a random probability against the death rate.

Also, set target volume and parameters for volume plugin.\n\nIn the step method, during each MC step, iterate through cells and apply death probability. Maybe if a random number is below deathRate, mark the cell for death.
