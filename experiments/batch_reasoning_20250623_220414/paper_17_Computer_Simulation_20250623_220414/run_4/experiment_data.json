Unlike earlier simulations that focused on the arrangements of cells within individual ommatidia, here we examine the local movements that lead to large-scale organization of the emerging eye field. Simulations based on our experimental observations of cell adhesion, cell death, and cell movement successfully patterned a tracing of an emerging wild-type pupal eye. Surprisingly, altering cell adhesion had only a mild effect on patterning, contradicting our previous hypothesis that the patterning was primarily the result of referential adhesion between IRMclass surface proteins.

We tested this prediction experimentally by preventing expansion in the apical area of individual cells: patterning was disrupted in a manner predicted by our simulations.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants a JSON object with ontology annotations based on the provided biological description. The categories must be exact: CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH. Each entry needs an exact ID and term name without extra spaces.\n\nFirst, I'll look for cell types mentioned. The text talks about \"glial-like support cells\" in the Drosophila pupal eye. Checking Cell Ontology, \"glial cell\" is CL:0000122. So CellOntology will have that.\n\nNext, Gene Ontology terms. The processes mentioned include cell adhesion (GO:0007155), programmed cell death (GO:0012501), cell movement (GO:0016477), and cell surface area expansion, which relates to cell morphogenesis (GO:0000902). These GO IDs need to be included under GeneOntology.\n\nFor MeSH terms, the study involves computer simulation (D003197), Drosophila (D004305), and epithelial cells (D004848). Also, the Glazier\u2013Graner\u2013Hogeweg model is a computational biology method (D019284). These MeSH terms should be added.\n\nNeed to ensure IDs are correctly formatted without spaces. Terms like \"Glial Cell\" match the exact term in Cell Ontology. Double-check each ID and term name. Make sure there are no typos. Also, confirm that all relevant terms from the text are included. Processes like cell adhesion, death, movement, and morphogenesis are key here. The MeSH terms cover the model organisms and methods used. Alright, that should cover all necessary annotations.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000122\",\n            \"term\": \"Glial Cell\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000066\",\n            \"term\": \"Epithelial Cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007155\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0012501\",\n            \"term\": \"Programmed Cell Death\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0016477\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Migration\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0000902\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Morphogenesis\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D003197\",\n            \"term\": \"Computer Simulation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D004305\",\n            \"term\": \"Drosophila\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D004848\",\n            \"term\": \"Epithelial Cells\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D019284\",\n            \"term\": \"Computational Biology\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```"
