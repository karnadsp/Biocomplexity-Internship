This process of cell movements organizes the ommatidial array into a functional pattern. Unlike earlier simulations that focused on the arrangements of cells within individual ommatidia, here we examine the local movements that lead to large-scale organization of the emerging eye field. Simulations based on our experimental observations of cell adhesion, cell death, and cell movement successfully patterned a tracing of an emerging wild-type pupal eye. Surprisingly, altering cell adhesion had only a mild effect on patterning, contradicting our previous hypothesis that the patterning was primarily the result of referential adhesion between IRMclass surface proteins.

We tested this prediction experimentally by preventing expansion in the apical area of individual cells: patterning was disrupted in a manner predicted by our simulations. Our work demonstrates the value of combining computer simulation with in vivo experiments to uncover novel mechanisms that are perpetuated throughout the eye field.

      "response": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this request. The user wants a JSON object with ontology annotations based on the provided biological study. The key points are about the assembly of glial-like support cells in the Drosophila pupal eye, involving processes like cell adhesion, programmed cell death (PCD), apical surface area expansion, and the use of the GGH model.\n\nFirst, I need to identify relevant ontologies: CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH. Let's start with CellOntology. The study mentions \"glial-like support cells.\" Looking up Cell Ontology, I find \"glial cell\" is CL:0000122. But the term here is \"glial-like,\" which might not have a direct term. However, since the cells are support cells in the eye, maybe \"glial cell\" is the closest. Alternatively, check if \"epithelial cell\" is relevant. The study discusses epithelia in development, so CL:0000066 for epithelial cell is a fit. The hexagonal lattice structure might be part of epithelial organization.\n\nNext, GeneOntology. Processes involved are cell adhesion (GO:0007155), programmed cell death (GO:0012501), cell movement (GO:0016477), and cell apical surface area expansion. For apical surface area, maybe \"cell morphogenesis\" (GO:0000902) or \"regulation of cell size\" (GO:0008361). Also, \"cell-cell adhesion\" (GO:0098609) is more specific than general cell adhesion. The study mentions cell rearrangement, so \"cell rearrangement\" (GO:0060028) might apply. The GGH model relates to modeling biological processes, so \"in silico simulation\" (GO:0043934) is a term used for computational simulations in biology.\n\nFor MeSH terms, the study involves Drosophila, so \"Drosophila melanogaster\" (D004305). Programmed cell death is MeSH D017209. Cell adhesion is MeSH D002448. Cell movement is MeSH D002465. The Glazier-Graner-Hogeweg model (GGH) is a computational model, so \"Models, Biological\" (D008957) or more specific terms. \"Epithelium\" (D004848) is relevant as the study focuses on developing epithelia. \"Computer Simulation\" (D003196) is another MeSH term here.\n\nNow, ensure all IDs are correctly formatted without spaces. Check each term's exactness. For example, \"Programmed Cell Death\" in GO is \"programmed cell death\" (term is case-insensitive?), but the exact term should be checked. The example uses \"Cell Division\" with capital letters, so likely terms are capitalized. Verify using ontology lookup tools if possible.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nCellOntology: Epithelial cell (CL:0000066) and possibly glial cell (CL:0000122), but the study's cells are glial-like support cells, which might not be a direct CL term. Since the process is in epithelial tissue, maybe just epithelial cell is sufficient.\n\nGeneOntology: Cell-cell adhesion (GO:0098609), programmed cell death (GO:0012501), cell movement (GO:0016477), cell morphogenesis (GO:0000902) for apical expansion, cell rearrangement (GO:0060028), and in silico simulation (GO:0043934).\n\nMeSH: Drosophila melanogaster (D004305), Programmed Cell Death (D017209), Cell Adhesion (D002448), Cell Movement (D002465), Models, Biological (D008957), Epithelium (D004848), Computer Simulation (D003196).\n\nMake sure no extra spaces in terms or IDs. Check exact term names. For example, \"Programmed Cell Death\" in MeSH is \"Apoptosis\" but the exact term might be \"Cell Death, Programmed\" or \"Programmed Cell Death\". MeSH entry D017209 is \"Apoptosis\", but the study uses \"programmed cell death (PCD)\", which is synonymous. However, MeSH uses \"Apoptosis\" as the main term, but there's also \"Cell Death\" (D002453). Need to confirm. Alternatively, \"Programmed Cell Death\" is a MeSH term with ID D017209. Checking MeSH, D017209 is indeed \"Apoptosis\", but the entry includes \"Programmed Cell Death\" as a synonym. However, the exact term in MeSH is \"Apoptosis\". Hmm, this is a problem. The user wants the exact term. Since the study mentions \"programmed cell death (PCD)\", but MeSH's exact term is \"Apoptosis\". However, there's a MeSH term \"Cell Death\" (D002453) which includes PCD. Alternatively, perhaps \"Cell Death\" is the broader term. Alternatively, check if \"Programmed Cell Death\" is a separate MeSH term. Let me verify. Searching MeSH for \"programmed cell death\", the entry is under \"Apoptosis\" (D017209) with \"Programmed Cell Death\" as a synonym. So, the exact term is \"Apoptosis\", but the user might expect \"Programmed Cell Death\". However, according to MeSH, the preferred term is Apoptosis. But the user wants the term as used in the study. Since the study uses \"programmed cell death (PCD)\", but the MeSH term is \"Apoptosis\", perhaps using \"Apoptosis\" is correct. However, this is a conflict. The user might prefer the term as written, but MeSH might not have that exact term. Alternatively, \"Cell Death\" (D002453) is a broader term. The study mentions PCD specifically, so maybe using \"Apoptosis\" (D017209) is better. Need to decide based on MeSH's exact terms.\n\nSimilarly, \"Models, Biological\" (D008957) is a MeSH term. \"Computer Simulation\" is D003196. \"Epithelium\" is D004848.\n\nSo, compiling all:\n\nCellOntology: Epithelial cell (CL:0000066). Maybe also glial cell if appropriate, but since the cells are glial-like support cells, perhaps not a direct CL term. The example in the problem uses \"Epithelial\" as the term, but in CL, the term is \"epithelial cell\". Need to check. CL:0000066 is \"epithelial cell\". So the term should be \"epithelial cell\".\n\nGeneOntology: Terms related to cell adhesion (GO:0098609 cell-cell adhesion), programmed cell death (GO:0012501), cell movement (GO:0016477), cell morphogenesis (GO:0000902), cell rearrangement (GO:0060028), and in silico simulation (GO:0043934).\n\nMeSH: Apoptosis (D017209), Cell Adhesion (D002448), Cell Movement (D002465), Models, Biological (D008957), Epithelium (D004848), Computer Simulation (D003196), and Drosophila melanogaster (D004305).\n\nDouble-checking all IDs and terms:\n\nCellOntology:\n- \"id\": \"CL:0000066\", \"term\": \"epithelial cell\"\n\nGeneOntology:\n- \"id\": \"GO:0098609\", \"term\": \"cell-cell adhesion\"\n- \"id\": \"GO:0012501\", \"term\": \"programmed cell death\"\n- \"id\": \"GO:0016477\", \"term\": \"cell motility\" (Wait, GO:0016477 is \"cell motility\", which includes cell movement. The term \"cell movement\" might be a synonym. The exact term is \"cell motility\". But the user's example has \"Cell Division\" as the term. Need to check. GO:0016477 term name is \"cell motility\". But the study mentions \"cell movement\". Should I use the exact GO term or the term from the study? According to instructions, term names must be exact. So if the GO term is \"cell motility\", then that's the term to use. However, the study says \"cell movement\". Let me check. GO:0016477 is \"cell motility\", which is defined as \"Any process involved in the controlled self-propelled movement of a cell from one location to another.\" So \"cell motility\" is the exact term. The study uses \"cell movement\", which is a synonym. But per the user's instruction, the term must be exact. So the term here should be \"cell motility\".\n\nSimilarly, \"programmed cell death\" is GO:0012501, and the term is \"programmed cell death\".\n\nFor apical surface area expansion, looking for terms like \"cell morphogenesis\" (GO:0000902) or \"regulation of cell size\" (GO:0008361). The study mentions \"expansion of cells\u2019 apical surface areas, which promoted rearrangement of neighboring cells\". So \"cell morphogenesis\" might be appropriate. GO:0000902 is \"cell morphogenesis\", defined as \"The process in which structures of a cell are generated and organized. This process occurs while the cell is undergoing differentiation.\" So yes.\n\nCell rearrangement: GO:0060028 \"cell rearrangement\". Check the term. Yes, GO:0060028 is \"cell rearrangement\", defined as \"The process in which cells in an organized structure change their positions relative to one another.\"\n\nIn silico simulation: GO:0043934 \"in silico simulation\", defined as \"A process of implementing a model in a"
