      "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a JSON object with ontology annotations based on the provided biological description. Let me start by parsing the original text to identify relevant terms for each ontology category: CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH.\n\nFirst, looking at CellOntology. The text mentions \"glial-like support cells\" and \"epithelia\". The term \"glial cell\" might correspond to a Cell Ontology term. Checking, there's CL:0000125 for glial cell. Also, \"epithelial cells\" would be CL:0000066.\n\nNext, GeneOntology. The processes discussed include cell adhesion (GO:0007155), programmed cell death (GO:0012501), cell movement (GO:0016477), and cell proliferation (maybe GO:0008283). Wait, the text mentions cell death and cell movement. Let me confirm the GO terms. Programmed cell death is indeed GO:0012501. Cell adhesion is GO:0007155. Cell motility is GO:0016477. Also, there's mention of apical surface area expansion, which relates to cell morphogenesis, so GO:0000902 (cell morphogenesis).\n\nFor MeSH terms, the simulation uses the Glazier\u2013Graner\u2013Hogeweg model, which is a cellular automaton model. MeSH has \"Models, Biological\" as D008964. \"Cell Movement\" is D002465. \"Cell Death\" is D016923. \"Cell Adhesion\" is D002448. \"Epithelium\" is D004848. Also, \"Computer Simulation\" is D003198.\n\nWait, the example format uses exact term names. So \"Programmed Cell Death\" for MeSH? Let me check. MeSH term for programmed cell death is D017209. The term name is \"Apoptosis\", but the text mentions programmed cell death (PCD), which is a broader term. However, in MeSH, D017209 is \"Apoptosis\", which is a type of PCD. Alternatively, \"Cell Death\" is D016923. Since the text uses \"programmed cell death\", maybe use D017209 with term \"Apoptosis\"? Or is there a more precise term? The MeSH term for \"Programmed Cell Death\" is D017209. Wait, checking MeSH database: \"Apoptosis\" is D017209, and \"Cell Death\" is D016923. The text mentions PCD, so maybe using D017209 even though the term name is Apoptosis. Alternatively, perhaps the correct term is D016923 for general cell death, but the process here is programmed. Hmm. The user might expect \"Programmed Cell Death\" as the term, but MeSH might not have that exact term. Let me check. Searching MeSH for \"programmed cell death\" leads to D017209 (Apoptosis) as the primary term, but there's also \"Necroptosis\" and others. Since the text refers to PCD, perhaps using D017209 (Apoptosis) as the closest, even though it's a specific type. Alternatively, maybe the term is \"Cell Death\" (D016923). The user might prefer the exact term from the text. But the MeSH terms need to be exact as per their database. Since the original text says \"programmed cell death (PCD)\", and MeSH lists \"Apoptosis\" as D017209, which is a form of PCD, maybe that's the best fit. Alternatively, if there's a MeSH term for \"Programmed Cell Death\", but I don't think there is. So perhaps include both \"Cell Death\" and \"Apoptosis\". Wait, the original text mentions \"programmed cell death (PCD)\" as a key factor, so perhaps using D017209 (Apoptosis) and D016923 (Cell Death). But need to check the context. The simulations highlighted the importance of PCD, so maybe Apoptosis is appropriate here. I'll include D017209 with term \"Apoptosis\".\n\nAlso, \"Computer Simulation\" is D003198. \"Models, Biological\" is D008964. \"Cell Movement\" D002465, \"Cell Adhesion\" D002448, \"Epithelium\" D004848.\n\nNow, compiling all the terms. For CellOntology: glial cell (CL:0000125) and epithelial cell (CL:0000066). For GeneOntology: cell adhesion (GO:0007155), programmed cell death (GO:0012501), cell motility (GO:0016477), cell morphogenesis (GO:0000902). For MeSH: Models, Biological (D008964), Cell Movement (D002465), Cell Death (D016923), Apoptosis (D017209), Cell Adhesion (D002448), Epithelium (D004848), Computer Simulation (D003198).\n\nWait, the user example had \"Epithelial\" as the term, but the correct term in Cell Ontology is \"epithelial cell\". The example in the user's message shows \"Epithelial\" as the term. But in the Cell Ontology, the term is \"epithelial cell\" (CL:0000066). However, the user's example uses \"Epithelial\" as the term. But the instructions say term names must be exact. So I need to check the exact term. Looking up CL:0000066, the label is \"epithelial cell\". So the term should be \"epithelial cell\". Similarly, for glial cell, CL:0000125 is \"glial cell\". So the terms should be exact. Therefore, in CellOntology, the terms are \"glial cell\" and \"epithelial cell\". The user example used \"Epithelial\", but maybe that's a simplification. However, per instructions, term names must be exact. So I must use the exact term from the ontology.\n\nWait, the original text mentions \"glial-like support cells\" which are a type of glial cell. So CL:0000125 is correct. Similarly, \"epithelia\" refers to epithelial cells.\n\nFor GeneOntology, the terms are cell adhesion (GO:0007155), programmed cell death (GO:0012501), cell motility (GO:0016477), and cell morphogenesis involved in differentiation (GO:0000902). Wait, cell morphogenesis is GO:0000902, but the text mentions expansion of cells' apical surface areas promoting rearrangement. Maybe cell morphogenesis is appropriate here.\n\nMeSH terms: \"Models, Biological\" (D008964), \"Cell Movement\" (D002465), \"Cell Death\" (D016923), \"Apoptosis\" (D017209), \"Cell Adhesion\" (D002448), \"Epithelium\" (D004848), \"Computer Simulation\" (D003198). The text also mentions \"Glazier\u2013Graner\u2013Hogeweg model (GGH)\", which is a type of cellular automaton model. So \"Models, Biological\" would cover that.\n\nNow, compiling all these into the JSON structure as per the example. Ensuring category names are exact, IDs without spaces, and terms exact.\n\nSo the JSON would look like this:\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000125\",\n            \"term\": \"glial cell\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000066\",\n            \"term\": \"epithelial cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007155\",\n            \"term\": \"cell adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0012501\",\n            \"term\": \"programmed cell death\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0016477\",\n            \"term\": \"cell motility\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0000902\",\n            \"term\": \"cell morphogenesis\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D008964\",\n            \"term\": \"Models, Biological\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002465\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Movement\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D016923\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Death\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D017209\",\n            \"term\": \"Apoptosis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002448\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D004848\",\n            \"term\": \"Epithelium\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D003198\",\n            \"term\": \"Computer Simulation\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nI need to ensure that all terms are exactly as in their respective ontologies. For example, \"programmed cell death\" in GO is the exact term for GO:0012501. Yes, checking GO:0012501, the term is \"programmed cell death\". For MeSH, \"Apoptosis\" is the term for D017209, which is correct. \"Models, Biological\" is the correct term for D008964. All other terms also match. The IDs are correctly formatted without spaces. The category names are exact as specified. This should meet the user's requirements.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000125\",\n            \"term\": \"glial cell\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:000"

CompuCellSetup is needed to set up the simulation, and I'll import steppables from the cc3d module. Also, the core modules like Cell, Potts, and VolumePlugin are required.\n\nNext, the simulation class. It should inherit from steppables.SteppableBasePy.
