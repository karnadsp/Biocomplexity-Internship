        "description": "We present a computer simulation and associated experimental validation of assembly of glial-like support cells into the interweaving hexagonal lattice that spans the Drosophila pupal eye. This process of cell movements organizes the ommatidial array into a functional pattern. Unlike earlier simulations that focused on the arrangements of cells within individual ommatidia, here we examine the local movements that lead to large-scale organization of the emerging eye field. Simulations based on our experimental observations of cell adhesion, cell death, and cell movement successfully patterned a tracing of an emerging wild-type pupal eye. Surprisingly, altering cell adhesion had only a mild effect on patterning, contradicting our previous hypothesis that the patterning was primarily the result of referential adhesion between IRMclass surface proteins. Instead, our simulations highlighted the importance of programmed cell death (PCD) as well as a previously unappreciated variable: the expansion of cells\u2019 apical surface areas, which promoted rearrangement of neighboring cells. We tested this prediction experimentally by preventing expansion in the apical area of individual cells: patterning was disrupted in a manner predicted by our simulations. Our work demonstrates the value of combining computer simulation with in vivo experiments to uncover novel mechanisms that are perpetuated throughout the eye field. It also demonstrates the utility of the Glazier\u2013Graner\u2013Hogeweg model (GGH) for modeling the links between local cellular interactions and emergent properties of developing epithelia as well as predicting unanticipated results in vivo."

      "response": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this. The user wants a JSON object with ontology annotations based on the provided biological study about glial-like support cells in the Drosophila pupal eye. They specified CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH categories with exact IDs and terms.\n\nFirst, I'll look for Cell Ontology terms. The study mentions \"glial-like support cells.\" Glial cells in fruit flies might correspond to CL:0000120 for glial cells. Also, the process involves epithelial cells forming a hexagonal lattice, so CL:0000066 (epithelial cell) fits here. The pupal eye is part of the developing epithelium, so maybe CL:0002076 (epithelial cell of developing epithelium) applies.\n\nNext, Gene Ontology terms. The study talks about cell adhesion (GO:0007155), programmed cell death (GO:0012501), cell movement (GO:0016477), and cell apical surface area expansion. Apical surface area changes might relate to cell morphogenesis (GO:0000902). Tissue morphogenesis (GO:0009653) could also be relevant as the overall pattern forms.\n\nFor MeSH terms, \"cell adhesion\" is D002448, \"cell death\" is D016923, \"cell movement\" D002465, and \"epithelium\" D004848. The simulation uses the Glazier\u2013Graner\u2013Hogeweg model, which is a cellular automaton model. MeSH doesn't have a specific term for GGH, but maybe \"Models, Biological\" D008957 applies here.\n\nI need to ensure all IDs are correctly formatted without spaces, and terms are exact. Let me double-check each term against the ontologies. Glial cells: CL:0000120. Epithelial cells: CL:0000066 and CL:0002076. GO terms: adhesion, death, movement, morphogenesis. MeSH: adhesion, death, movement, epithelium, biological models.\n\nLooks good. Now structure them into the JSON with the correct category names and no extra explanations.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000120\",\n            \"term\": \"glial cell\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000066\",\n            \"term\": \"epithelial cell\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0002076\",\n            \"term\": \"epithelial cell of developing epithelium\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007155\",\n            \"term\": \"cell adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0012501\",\n            \"term\": \"programmed cell death\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0016477\",\n            \"term\": \"cell movement\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0000902\",\n            \"term\": \"cell morphogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0009653\",\n            \"term\": \"tissue morphogenesis\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002448\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D016923\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Death\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002465\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Movement\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D004848\",\n            \"term\": \"Epithelium\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D008957\",\n            \"term\": \"Models, Biological\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"
