      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by breaking down the original description. The study is about ovarian cancer relapse, focusing on how cancer cells interact with the peritoneal tumor microenvironment. They used a xenograft model with SKOV3.ip1 cells, intraperitoneal injection, and looked at things like homotypic adhesion, spheroid formation, invasion, angiogenesis, etc.\n\nFirst, for Cell Ontology (CellOntology), the main cell type mentioned is ovarian cancer cells. The Cell Ontology term for ovarian cancer cell is CL:0001063. So that's one entry. They also mention the peritoneal cavity, which might involve mesothelial cells. Looking up, mesothelial cell is CL:0000077. So those two terms should be included.\n\nNext, Gene Ontology (GeneOntology). The processes involved here include homotypic cell adhesion (GO:0034101), chemotaxis (GO:0006935), angiogenesis (GO:0001525), and response to hypoxia (GO:0001666). Also, tumor invasion involves cell-matrix adhesion (GO:0007160). The study talks about vascularization, so angiogenesis is key. The constitutive release of angiogenic factors even without hypoxia might relate to positive regulation of angiogenesis (GO:0045766). Wait, the original says \"rapid neovascularization... triggered by constitutive release of angiogenic factors in the absence of hypoxia.\" So maybe GO:0045766 (positive regulation of angiogenesis) is better here. Also, cell adhesion in general would be GO:0007155. Let me check the exact terms. Homotypic cell adhesion is GO:0034101. Cell-cell adhesion is GO:0016337. Wait, the description emphasizes homotypic adhesion in tumor formation, so GO:0034101 is correct. The OvTM model looks at cell attachment, which might be cell-matrix adhesion (GO:0007160). Chemotaxis is GO:0006935. Vascularization is angiogenesis (GO:0001525). The release of angiogenic factors leading to neovascularization would be positive regulation of angiogenesis (GO:0045766). Also, the tumor microenvironment's role might involve response to hypoxia, but the study mentions the absence of hypoxia, so maybe that term isn't applicable. Wait, the study says \"constitutive release of angiogenic factors in the absence of hypoxia.\" So hypoxia response might not be relevant. Instead, focus on angiogenesis regulation. So compiling these: GO:0034101 (homotypic cell adhesion), GO:0006935 (chemotaxis), GO:0007160 (cell-matrix adhesion), GO:0045766 (positive regulation of angiogenesis), and maybe GO:0001525 (angiogenesis). Let me confirm the exact terms. Homotypic cell-cell adhesion is indeed GO:0034101. Chemotaxis is GO:0006935. Cell-matrix adhesion is GO:0007160. Positive regulation of angiogenesis is GO:0045766. Angiogenesis is GO:0001525. All these seem relevant.\n\nFor MeSH terms, the topics include ovarian neoplasms (D010051), neoplasm metastasis (D009362), tumor microenvironment (D060745), xenograft model (D058929), peritoneal cavity (D010516), neovascularization, pathologic (D018719), cell adhesion (D015815), and computer simulation (D003198). The study uses a xenograft model, so D058929. The peritoneal cavity is mentioned, D010516. Pathologic neovascularization is D018719. Tumor microenvironment is D060745. Ovarian cancer is D010051. Metastasis is D009362. Cell adhesion is D015815. Computer simulation for the OvTM model is D003198. All these MeSH terms fit.\n\nNow, need to format exactly as specified. Check IDs for correctness. For example, CellOntology IDs must start with CL: and be seven digits. CL:0001063 (ovarian cancer cell) and CL:0000077 (mesothelial cell) are correct. GeneOntology IDs: GO:0034101, GO:0006935, GO:0007160, GO:0045766, GO:0001525. MeSH IDs: D010051, D009362, D060745, D058929, D010516, D018719, D015815, D003198. Term names must be exact. For example, \"Cell-Matrix Adhesion\" for GO:0007160. \"Positive regulation of angiogenesis\" for GO:0045766. \"Angiogenesis\" for GO:0001525. MeSH terms like \"Ovarian Neoplasms\", \"Neoplasm Metastasis\", etc.\n\nCheck if any terms are missing. The study also mentions vascularization, which is covered by angiogenesis terms. The peritoneal tumor microenvironment is covered by the MeSH term tumor microenvironment. The cellular Potts model falls under computer simulation. Invasion is part of neoplasm metastasis. Homotypic adhesion is covered. All seems covered. Make sure there are no extra spaces in terms. JSON structure must have the exact category names: CellOntology, GeneOntology, MeSH. Arrays of objects with id and term. No extra fields. That's it.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0001063\",\n            \"term\": \"Ovarian Cancer Cell\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000077\",\n            \"term\": \"Mesothelial Cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0034101\",\n            \"term\": \"Homotypic Cell-Cell Adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0006935\",\n            \"term\": \"Chemotaxis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007160\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell-Matrix Adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0045766\",\n            \"term\": \"Positive Regulation of Angiogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0001525\",\n            \"term\": \"Angiogenesis\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D010051\",\n            \"term\": \"Ovarian Neoplasms\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D009362\",\n            \"term\": \"Neoplasm Metastasis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D060745\",\n            \"term\": \"Tumor Microenvironment\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D058929\",\n            \"term\": \"Xenograft Model\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D010516\",\n            \"term\": \"Peritoneal Cavity\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D018719\",\n            \"term\": \"Neovascularization, Pathologic\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D015815\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D003198\",\n            \"term\": \"Computer Simulation\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"

Basic cell types and parameters based on the ontology annotations",
      "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file based on the given ontology annotations. Let me start by understanding the requirements.\n\nFirst, the user specified two cell types: Ovarian Cancer Cell and Mesothelial Cell. So, I'll define these in the simulation. In CompuCell3D, cell types are typically set up using the `CellType` plugin. I'll assign each a type ID and name.\n\nNext, the Gene Ontology terms include adhesion, chemotaxis, and angiogenesis-related processes. For adhesion, I'll use the `Contact` plugin to handle cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion by setting appropriate contact energies. Chemotaxis can be implemented with the `Chemotaxis` plugin, making the cancer cells move towards a chemical gradient\u2014maybe a secretion from mesothelial cells. Angiogenesis might be modeled by having some factor (like VEGF) secreted by cancer cells that promotes neovascularization. But since angiogenesis is complex, perhaps I'll simulate it by having a chemical that affects cell behavior.\n\nThe MeSH terms mention the peritoneal cavity and tumor microenvironment, so setting up the simulation lattice to represent a section of the peritoneal cavity makes sense. The xenograft model suggests using a 3D environment, but I'll stick with 2D for simplicity unless specified otherwise. The simulation will involve metastasis, so cancer cells might invade the mesothelial layer.\n\nNow, structuring the code. The necessary imports are CompuCellSetup and relevant modules. The simulation class should inherit from SteppableBasePy. The __init__ method needs to call the parent's init. In the start method, I'll initialize cell types, set up the volume constraint, adhesion parameters, and chemotaxis. The step method can handle processes like secreting chemicals each step.\n\nFor the volume constraint, both cell types will have a target volume and lambda. Contact energy between cells and the medium (matrix) and between different cell types should be defined. Ovarian cells might have lower adhesion to mesothelial cells to simulate invasion. Chemotaxis parameters will direct cancer cells towards a chemoattractant secreted by mesothelial cells.\n\nIn the start method, I'll also create a cluster of cancer cells surrounded by mesothelial cells. Using a line of cells for mesothelial layer and a central cluster for cancer. Secretion of a chemical (like \"VEGF\") by cancer cells can be set up, which mesothelial cells might degrade.\n\nIn the step method, during each step, maybe mesothelial cells secrete a chemoattractant, and cancer cells secrete VEGF. But since the step method runs every MCS, I need to update the chemical fields accordingly. However, CompuCell3D handles secretion in the diffusion solver, so I need to set up a secretion data in the PDE solver. Alternatively, using the FlexibleDiffusionSolverFE for chemical fields and setting secretion rates in the steppable.\n\nWait, the user didn't mention specific chemicals, so I'll need to make some assumptions. Let's create two chemicals: \"Chemoattractant\" secreted by mesothelial cells to which cancer cells chemotax, and \"VEGF\" secreted by cancer cells to simulate angiogenesis signaling.\n\nPutting it all together: imports, simulation class with init, start, step. The start method initializes cell types, volume constraints, contact energies, chemotaxis, and sets up the initial cell layout. The step method could handle dynamic behaviors, but maybe for a basic simulation, the start method suffices. However, the user asked for the step method to be included, so I'll have it, even if it's just incrementing a step counter or something minimal.\n\nAlso, need to register the steppable with CompuCellSetup. The XML part is usually separate, but since the user wants a Python file, maybe using the XMLWriter to set up the simulation. But perhaps the code uses the newer syntax where plugins are configured via Python. Let me check.\n\nIn the code, after the imports, the main part configures the simulator with plugins like Volume, Contact, Chemotaxis, and FlexibleDiffusionSolverFE. Then the steppable is registered.\n\nSo, the final code will have:\n\n- Imports: CompuCellSetup, steppables, cc3d, etc.\n- Simulation class with __init__, start, step.\n- In start, initialize cell types, set up volume, contact, chemotaxis.\n- Create initial cells: mesothelial layer and cancer cluster.\n- Set up chemical fields and secretion parameters.\n- In step, maybe update something, but for simplicity, just pass.\n- Register the simulation and necessary modules.\n\nLet me draft the code step by step.\n\nFirst, the imports:\n\nimport sys\nfrom cc3d.core.PyCoreSpecs import *\nimport cc3d.CompuCellSetup as CompuCellSetup\n\nThen, the simulator configuration. Wait, maybe using the core specifications to set up plugins. The user might be using the newer syntax where you create a core specification object and add specs to it.\n\nBut perhaps the user expects the traditional way with a simulation class. Hmm. The user said \"proper simulation class that inherits from steppables.SteppableBasePy\". So maybe using the older steppable approach.\n\nWait, in the example code, they might have:\n\nfrom cc3d import CompuCellSetup\nfrom cc3d.core import XMLUtils\nfrom cc3d.cpp import CompuCell\n\nclass SimulationSteppable(steppables.SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, simulator):\n        super().__init__(simulator)\n        ...\n\nBut perhaps the correct way is to use the newer API with specs. But given the user asked for a basic setup, maybe the traditional method is better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer combines both XML configuration via Python and steppables.\n\nBut the user's answer example likely includes the standard code structure with a simulation class that has start and step methods, initializing cell types, plugins, etc.\n\nLet me proceed.\n\nFirst, the code starts with necessary imports:\n\nfrom cc3d.CompuCellSetup import *\nfrom cc3d import steppables\nimport cc3d.CompuCellSetup as CompuCellSetup\n\nThen, define the simulation class:\n\nclass SimulationSteppable(steppables.SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, simulator, frequency=1):\n        super().__init__(simulator, frequency)\n        # Initialize any variables here if needed\n\n    def start(self):\n        # Initialize cell types, plugins, etc.\n        # Cell types\n        self.cell_type_oc = self.create_cell_type(\"Ovarian Cancer Cell\", \"CL:0001063\")\n        self.cell_type_mc = self.create_cell_type(\"Mesothelial Cell\", \"CL:0000077\")\n\n        # Volume constraint\n        self.configure_volume_plugin()\n        # Contact adhesion\n        self.configure_contact_plugin()\n        # Chemotaxis\n        self.configure_chemotaxis_plugin()\n        # Angiogenesis-related secretion (VEGF)\n        self.configure_secretion_plugin()\n\n        # Initialize cell layout\n        self.initialize_cells()\n\n    def configure_volume_plugin(self):\n        # Volume parameters for both cell types\n        volume_params = VolumePluginParams()\n        volume_params.params_dict[self.cell_type_oc] = {'target_volume': 25, 'lambda_volume': 2.0}\n        volume_params.params_dict[self.cell_type_mc] = {'target_volume': 25, 'lambda_volume': 2.0}\n        self.set_volume_parameters(volume_params)\n\n    def configure_contact_plugin(self):\n        # Contact energies between cell types and medium\n        contact_energy_oc_oc = 10  # Homotypic adhesion for cancer cells\n        contact_energy_mc_mc = 15  # Homotypic adhesion for mesothelial\n        contact_energy_oc_mc = 20  # Heterotypic adhesion\n        contact_energy_medium = 5  # Adhesion with medium (matrix)\n\n        contact_params = ContactPluginParams()\n        contact_params.params_dict[(self.cell_type_oc, self.cell_type_oc)] = contact_energy_oc_oc\n        contact_params.params_dict[(self.cell_type_mc, self.cell_type_mc)] = contact_energy_mc_mc\n        contact_params.params_dict[(self.cell_type_oc, self.cell_type_mc)] = contact_energy_oc_mc\n        contact_params.params_dict[(self.cell_type_oc, 'Medium')] = contact_energy_medium\n        contact_params.params_dict[(self.cell_type_mc, 'Medium')] = contact_energy_medium\n        self.set_contact_parameters(contact_params)\n\n    def configure_chemotaxis_plugin(self):\n        # Cancer cells chemotax towards chemoattractant secreted by mesothelial\n        chemotaxis_params = ChemotaxisParams()\n        chemotaxis_params.add_chemical(\"Chemoattractant\")\n        chemotaxis_params.set_params(self.cell_type_oc, \"Chemoattractant\", lambda_chemo=100, positive=True)\n        self.set_chemotaxis_parameters(chemotaxis_params)\n\n    def configure_secretion_plugin(self):\n        # Secretion of VEGF by cancer cells and degradation by mesothelial\n        secretion_params = SecretionParams()\n        secretion_params.add_secretion_data(self.cell_type_oc, \"VEGF\", 10.0)\n        secretion_params.add_secretion_data(self.c"

Let me confirm the exact terms. Homotypic cell-cell adhesion is indeed GO:0034101. Chemotaxis is GO:0006935. Cell-matrix adhesion is GO:0007160. Positive regulation of angiogenesis is GO:0045766. Angiogenesis is GO:0001525. All these seem relevant.\n\nFor MeSH terms, the topics include ovarian neoplasms (D010051), neoplasm metastasis (D009362), tumor microenvironment (D060745), xenograft model (D058929), peritoneal cavity (D010516), neovascularization, pathologic (D018719), cell adhesion (D015815), and computer simulation (D003198). The study uses a xenograft model, so D058929. The peritoneal cavity is mentioned, D010516. Pathologic neovascularization is D018719. Tumor microenvironment is D060745. Ovarian cancer is D010051. Metastasis is D009362. Cell adhesion is D015815. Computer simulation for the OvTM model is D003198. All these MeSH terms fit.\n\nNow, need to format exactly as specified. Check IDs for correctness. For example, CellOntology IDs must start with CL: and be seven digits. CL:0001063 (ovarian cancer cell) and CL:0000077 (mesothelial cell) are correct. GeneOntology IDs: GO:0034101, GO:0006935, GO:0007160, GO:0045766, GO:0001525. MeSH IDs: D010051, D009362, D060745, D058929, D010516, D018719, D015815, D003198. Term names must be exact. For example, \"Cell-Matrix Adhesion\" for GO:0007160. \"Positive regulation of angiogenesis\" for GO:0045766. \"Angiogenesis\" for GO:0001525. MeSH terms like \"Ovarian Neoplasms\", \"Neoplasm Metastasis\", etc.\n\nCheck if any terms are missing. The study also mentions vascularization, which is covered by angiogenesis terms. The peritoneal tumor microenvironment is covered by the MeSH term tumor microenvironment. The cellular Potts model falls under computer simulation. Invasion is part of neoplasm metastasis. Homotypic adhesion is covered. All seems covered. Make sure there are no extra spaces in terms. JSON structure must have the exact category names: CellOntology, GeneOntology, MeSH. Arrays of objects with id and term. No extra fields. That's it.\n</think>",

      "python_code": "from cc3d.core.PySteppables import *\n\n<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file based on the given ontology annotations. Let me start by understanding the requirements.\n\nFirst, the user specified two cell types: Ovarian Cancer Cell and Mesothelial Cell. So, I'll define these in the simulation. In CompuCell3D, cell types are typically set up using the `CellType` plugin. I'll assign each a type ID and name.\n\nNext, the Gene Ontology terms include adhesion, chemotaxis, and angiogenesis-related processes. For adhesion, I'll use the `Contact` plugin to handle cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion by setting appropriate contact energies. Chemotaxis can be implemented with the `Chemotaxis` plugin, making the cancer cells move towards a chemical gradient\u2014maybe a secretion from mesothelial cells. Angiogenesis might be modeled by having some factor (like VEGF) secreted by cancer cells that promotes neovascularization. But since angiogenesis is complex, perhaps I'll simulate it by having a chemical that affects cell behavior.\n\nThe MeSH terms mention the peritoneal cavity and tumor microenvironment, so setting up the simulation lattice to represent a section of the peritoneal cavity makes sense. The xenograft model suggests using a 3D environment, but I'll stick with 2D for simplicity unless specified otherwise. The simulation will involve metastasis, so cancer cells might invade the mesothelial layer.\n\nNow, structuring the code. The necessary imports are CompuCellSetup and relevant modules. The simulation class should inherit from SteppableBasePy. The __init__ method needs to call the parent's init. In the start method, I'll initialize cell types, set up the volume constraint, adhesion parameters, and chemotaxis. The step method can handle processes like secreting chemicals each step.\n\nFor the volume constraint, both cell types will have a target volume and lambda. Contact energy between cells and the medium (matrix) and between different cell types should be defined. Ovarian cells might have lower adhesion to mesothelial cells to simulate invasion. Chemotaxis parameters will direct cancer cells towards a chemoattractant secreted by mesothelial cells.\n\nIn the start method, I'll also create a cluster of cancer cells surrounded by mesothelial cells. Using a line of cells for mesothelial layer and a central cluster for cancer. Secretion of a chemical (like \"VEGF\") by cancer cells can be set up, which mesothelial cells might degrade.\n\nIn the step method, during each step, maybe mesothelial cells secrete a chemoattractant, and cancer cells secrete VEGF. But since the step method runs every MCS, I need to update the chemical fields accordingly. However, CompuCell3D handles secretion in the diffusion solver, so I need to set up a secretion data in the PDE solver. Alternatively, using the FlexibleDiffusionSolverFE for chemical fields and setting secretion rates in the steppable.\n\nWait, the user didn't mention specific chemicals, so I'll need to make some assumptions. Let's create two chemicals: \"Chemoattractant\" secreted by mesothelial cells to which cancer cells chemotax, and \"VEGF\" secreted by cancer cells to simulate angiogenesis signaling.\n\nPutting it all together: imports, simulation class with init, start, step. The start method initializes cell types, volume constraints, contact energies, chemotaxis, and sets up the initial cell layout. The step method could handle dynamic behaviors, but maybe for a basic simulation, the start method suffices. However, the user asked for the step method to be included, so I'll have it, even if it's just incrementing a step counter or something minimal.\n\nAlso, need to register the steppable with CompuCellSetup. The XML part is usually separate, but since the user wants a Python file, maybe using the XMLWriter to set up the simulation. But perhaps the code uses the newer syntax where plugins are configured via Python. Let me check.\n\nIn the code, after the imports, the main part configures the simulator with plugins like Volume, Contact, Chemotaxis, and FlexibleDiffusionSolverFE. Then the steppable is registered.\n\nSo, the final code will have:\n\n- Imports: CompuCellSetup, steppables, cc3d, etc.\n- Simulation class with __init__, start, step.\n- In start, initialize cell types, set up volume, contact, chemotaxis.\n- Create initial cells: mesothelial layer and cancer cluster.\n- Set up chemical fields and secretion parameters.\n- In step, maybe update something, but for simplicity, just pass.\n- Register the simulation and necessary modules.\n\nLet me draft the code step by step.\n\nFirst, the imports:\n\nimport sys\nfrom cc3d.core.PyCoreSpecs import *\nimport cc3d.CompuCellSetup as CompuCellSetup\n\nThen, the simulator configuration. Wait, maybe using the core specifications to set up plugins. The user might be using the newer syntax where you create a core specification object and add specs to it.\n\nBut perhaps the user expects the traditional way with a simulation class. Hmm. The user said \"proper simulation class that inherits from steppables.SteppableBasePy\". So maybe using the older steppable approach.\n\nWait, in the example code, they might have:\n\nfrom cc3d import CompuCellSetup\nfrom cc3d.core import XMLUtils\nfrom cc3d.cpp import CompuCell\n\nclass SimulationSteppable(steppables.SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, simulator):\n        super().__init__(simulator)\n        ...\n\nBut perhaps the correct way is to use the newer API with specs. But given the user asked for a basic setup, maybe the traditional method is better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer combines both XML configuration via Python and steppables.\n\nBut the user's answer example likely includes the standard code structure with a simulation class that has start and step methods, initializing cell types, plugins, etc.\n\nLet me proceed.\n\nFirst, the code starts with necessary imports:\n\nfrom cc3d.CompuCellSetup import *\nfrom cc3d import steppables\nimport cc3d.CompuCellSetup as CompuCellSetup\n\nThen, define the simulation class:\n\nclass SimulationSteppable(steppables.SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, simulator, frequency=1):\n        super().__init__(simulator, frequency)\n        # Initialize any variables here if needed\n\n    def start(self):\n        # Initialize cell types, plugins, etc.\n        # Cell types\n        self.cell_type_oc = self.create_cell_type(\"Ovarian Cancer Cell\", \"CL:0001063\")\n        self.cell_type_mc = self.create_cell_type(\"Mesothelial Cell\", \"CL:0000077\")\n\n        # Volume constraint\n        self.configure_volume_plugin()\n        # Contact adhesion\n        self.configure_contact_plugin()\n        # Chemotaxis\n        self.configure_chemotaxis_plugin()\n        # Angiogenesis-related secretion (VEGF)\n        self.configure_secretion_plugin()\n\n        # Initialize cell layout\n        self.initialize_cells()\n\n    def configure_volume_plugin(self):\n        # Volume parameters for both cell types\n        volume_params = VolumePluginParams()\n        volume_params.params_dict[self.cell_type_oc] = {'target_volume': 25, 'lambda_volume': 2.0}\n        volume_params.params_dict[self.cell_type_mc] = {'target_volume': 25, 'lambda_volume': 2.0}\n        self.set_volume_parameters(volume_params)\n\n    def configure_contact_plugin(self):\n        # Contact energies between cell types and medium\n        contact_energy_oc_oc = 10  # Homotypic adhesion for cancer cells\n        contact_energy_mc_mc = 15  # Homotypic adhesion for mesothelial\n        contact_energy_oc_mc = 20  # Heterotypic adhesion\n        contact_energy_medium = 5  # Adhesion with medium (matrix)\n\n        contact_params = ContactPluginParams()\n        contact_params.params_dict[(self.cell_type_oc, self.cell_type_oc)] = contact_energy_oc_oc\n        contact_params.params_dict[(self.cell_type_mc, self.cell_type_mc)] = contact_energy_mc_mc\n        contact_params.params_dict[(self.cell_type_oc, self.cell_type_mc)] = contact_energy_oc_mc\n        contact_params.params_dict[(self.cell_type_oc, 'Medium')] = contact_energy_medium\n        contact_params.params_dict[(self.cell_type_mc, 'Medium')] = contact_energy_medium\n        self.set_contact_parameters(contact_params)\n\n    def configure_chemotaxis_plugin(self):\n        # Cancer cells chemotax towards chemoattractant secreted by mesothelial\n        chemotaxis_params = ChemotaxisParams()\n        chemotaxis_params.add_chemical(\"Chemoattractant\")\n        chemotaxis_params.set_params(self.cell_type_oc, \"Chemoattractant\", lambda_chemo=100, positive=True)\n        self.set_chemotaxis_parameters(chemotaxis_params)\n\n    def configure_secretion_plugin(self):\n        # Secretion of VEGF by cancer cells and degradation by mesothelial\n        secretion_params = SecretionParams()\n        secretion_params.add_secretion_data(self.cell_type_oc, \"VEGF\", 10.0)\n        secretion_params.add_secretion_data(self.c",
