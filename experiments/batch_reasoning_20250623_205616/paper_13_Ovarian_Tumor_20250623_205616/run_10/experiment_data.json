        "description": "Ovarian cancer relapse is often characterized by metastatic spread throughout the peritoneal cavity with tumors attached to multiple organs. In this study, interaction of ovarian cancer cells with the peritoneal tumor microenvironment was evaluated in a xenograft model based on intraperitoneal injection of fluorescent SKOV3.ip1 ovarian cancer cells. Intra-vital microscopy of mixed GFP-red fluorescent protein (RFP) cell populations injected into the peritoneum demonstrated that cancer cells aggregate and attach as mixed spheroids, emphasizing the importance of homotypic adhesion in tumor formation. Electron microscopy provided high resolution structural information about local attachment sites. Experimental measurements from the mouse model were used to build a three-dimensional cellular Potts ovarian tumor model (OvTM) that examines ovarian cancer cell attachment, chemotaxis, growth, and vascularization. OvTM simulations provide insight into the relative influence of cancer cell\u2013cell adhesion, oxygen availability, and local architecture on tumor growth and morphology. Notably, tumors on the mesentery, omentum, or spleen readily invade the \u201copen\u201d architecture, while tumors attached to the gut encounter barriers that restrict invasion and instead rapidly expand into the peritoneal space. Simulations suggest that rapid neovascularization of SKOV3.ip1 tumors is triggered by constitutive release of angiogenic factors in the absence of hypoxia. This research highlights the importance of cellular adhesion and tumor microenvironment in the seeding of secondary ovarian tumors on diverse organs within the peritoneal cavity. Results of the OvTM simulations indicate that invasion is strongly influenced by features underlying the mesothelial lining at different sites, but is also affected by local production of chemotactic factors.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a JSON object with ontology annotations based on the provided information about ovarian cancer relapse and the study described. Let me start by parsing the original description to identify relevant terms for each ontology category: CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH.\n\nFirst, CellOntology. The study mentions SKOV3.ip1 ovarian cancer cells. I should check if there's a specific CL term for ovarian cancer cells. Also, the text talks about homotypic adhesion and tumor formation. Maybe terms like \"Cancer cell\" or \"Epithelial cell\" since ovarian cancer often originates from epithelial cells. Let me confirm the CL IDs. CL:0000000 is a placeholder; the actual ID for ovarian epithelial cells might be CL:0002632. Wait, I need to verify that. Alternatively, if \"Epithelial cell\" is more general, the CL ID would be CL:0000066. Let me check that. Yes, CL:0000066 is the correct ID for epithelial cell. Also, since the cells form spheroids, maybe \"Malignant cell\" which is CL:0001063. Hmm, but the exact term used in the study is ovarian cancer cells. If there's a specific term for ovarian cancer cells in CL, that would be better, but if not, using the more general terms might be necessary.\n\nNext, GeneOntology. The study mentions homotypic adhesion, chemotaxis, cell growth, vascularization, and angiogenesis. Relevant GO terms might include \"Cell-cell adhesion\" (GO:0098609), \"Chemotaxis\" (GO:0006935), \"Cell growth\" (GO:0016049), \"Angiogenesis\" (GO:0001525). Also, \"Response to hypoxia\" (GO:0001666) is mentioned because the simulations suggest neovascularization occurs without hypoxia. The term \"Vasculogenesis\" (GO:0001570) might be relevant if angiogenesis is part of that. Need to confirm the exact IDs. For example, angiogenesis is GO:0001525, cell-cell adhesion is GO:0098609, chemotaxis is GO:0006935, cell growth is GO:0016049, and response to hypoxia is GO:0001666.\n\nFor MeSH terms, the study involves ovarian cancer, peritoneal cavity, tumor microenvironment, xenograft models, neovascularization, and metastasis. MeSH terms could be \"Ovarian Neoplasms\" (D010051), \"Peritoneal Cavity\" (D010537), \"Tumor Microenvironment\" (D054278), \"Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays\" (D053683), \"Neovascularization, Pathologic\" (D054852), and \"Neoplasm Metastasis\" (D009362). Need to verify the exact MeSH IDs. For example, Ovarian Neoplasms is D010051, Peritoneal Cavity is D010537, Tumor Microenvironment is D054278, Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays is D053683, Neovascularization, Pathologic is D054852, and Neoplasm Metastasis is D009362.\n\nNow, ensure that the terms and IDs are exact. For example, \"Epithelial\" might need to be \"Epithelial cell\" in CellOntology. Wait, in the example given, the term was \"Epithelial\" but the correct term in CL might be \"Epithelial cell\". The user specified term names must be exact, so I need to check the actual ontology terms. Looking up CL:0000066, the term is \"epithelial cell\". So the term should be \"epithelial cell\" with lowercase? Wait, in the example, the term was \"Epithelial\" (capitalized). But ontology terms usually have specific capitalization. Let me check. The Cell Ontology terms are typically capitalized, like \"Epithelial Cell\". Wait, no, actually, looking at the CL ontology, terms are usually in title case. For example, \"epithelial cell\" is the term, but perhaps in the example, it's written as \"Epithelial\". Wait, the example given in the user's message has \"Epithelial\" as the term, but in reality, the correct term is \"epithelial cell\". Hmm, this is a problem. The user says to use the exact term names. So if the study mentions \"epithelial\" but the correct term is \"epithelial cell\", which one should I use? The user's example uses \"Epithelial\", but that might not be the actual term. To comply with the user's instructions, I need to ensure the term is exact as per the ontology. Let me check the actual Cell Ontology for \"epithelial cell\". The term is \"epithelial cell\" (CL:0000066). So the term should be \"epithelial cell\". However, the user's example uses \"Epithelial\" which is incorrect. But the user's instructions say term names must be exact. Therefore, I must use \"epithelial cell\" if that's the correct term. Similarly, for \"Mesenchymal\", but the study doesn't mention mesenchymal cells. The study talks about homotypic adhesion and spheroids. So in CellOntology, the relevant terms might be \"epithelial cell\" (CL:0000066), \"malignant cell\" (CL:0001063), and \"cancer cell\" (CL:0001063?) Wait, CL:0001063 is \"malignant cell\". But the study uses SKOV3.ip1 ovarian cancer cells, which are a type of cancer cell. So maybe \"cancer cell\" is CL:0001063. Let me check. Yes, CL:0001063 is \"malignant cell\", which is a cancer cell. So the term would be \"malignant cell\". Alternatively, if there's a more specific term for ovarian cancer cells, but I don't think there is. So CL:0001063 with term \"malignant cell\" would be appropriate.\n\nNow, GeneOntology. The study mentions homotypic adhesion, so \"cell-cell adhesion\" (GO:0098609). Chemotaxis (GO:0006935). Cell growth (GO:0016049). Angiogenesis (GO:0001525). Also, the simulation suggests neovascularization triggered by angiogenic factors, so \"angiogenesis\" is appropriate. The release of angiogenic factors in the absence of hypoxia might relate to \"positive regulation of angiogenesis\" (GO:0045766). But the study says \"constitutive release of angiogenic factors in the absence of hypoxia\", so maybe \"angiogenesis\" (GO:0001525) and \"response to hypoxia\" (GO:0001666), even though the angiogenesis here isn't hypoxia-driven. But the user might want to include terms related to hypoxia if it's mentioned. The study says \"simulations suggest that rapid neovascularization... in the absence of hypoxia\", so perhaps \"angiogenesis\" is the main term here.\n\nFor MeSH, the terms are Ovarian Neoplasms (D010051), Peritoneal Cavity (D010537), Tumor Microenvironment (D054278), Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays (D053683), Neovascularization, Pathologic (D054852), Neoplasm Metastasis (D009362). These all fit the study's context.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nCellOntology: malignant cell (CL:0001063), epithelial cell (CL:0000066) if mentioned. Wait, the study mentions ovarian cancer cells, which are epithelial in origin. So maybe both \"malignant cell\" and \"epithelial cell\". But does the text explicitly mention epithelial? The original description says \"ovarian cancer cells\", which are typically epithelial. The text mentions \"homotypic adhesion\", which is a feature of epithelial cells. So including \"epithelial cell\" might be appropriate. But does the study explicitly state they are epithelial? The SKOV3.ip1 cell line is derived from ovarian adenocarcinoma, which is epithelial. So including \"epithelial cell\" (CL:0000066) and \"malignant cell\" (CL:0001063).\n\nGeneOntology: cell-cell adhesion (GO:0098609), chemotaxis (GO:0006935), cell growth (GO:0016049), angiogenesis (GO:0001525), and maybe \"vasculogenesis\" (GO:0001570) if that's part of neovascularization. But the study mentions neovascularization, which is angiogenesis. So angiogenesis (GO:0001525) and maybe \"positive regulation of angiogenesis\" (GO:0045766) if applicable. But the user might just need the main terms mentioned. The study also talks about vascularization in the model, so angiogenesis is key.\n\nMeSH: Ovarian Neoplasms, Peritoneal Cavity, Tumor Microenvironment, Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays, Neovascularization, Pathologic, Neoplasm Metastasis.\n\nNow, cross-check all IDs:\n\nCellOntology:\n- CL:0001063 (malignant cell)\n- CL:0000066 (epithelial cell)\n\nGeneOntology:\n- GO:0098609 (cell-cell adhesion)\n- GO:0006935 (chemotaxis)\n- GO:0016049 (cell growth)\n- GO:0001525 (angiogenesis)\n- GO:0001666 (response to hypoxia)\n\nMeSH:\n- D010051 (Ovarian Neoplasms)\n- D010537 (Peritoneal Cavity)\n- D054278 (Tumor Microenvironment)\n- D053683 (Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays)\n- D054852 ("
