        "description": "Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a heterogeneous group of non-invasive lesions of the breast that result from abnormal proliferation of mammary epithelial cells. Pathologists characterize DCIS by four tissue morphologies (micropapillary, cribriform, solid, and comedo), but the underlying mechanisms that distinguish the development and progression of these morphologies are not well understood. Here we explored the conditions leading to the emergence of the different morphologies of DCIS using a two-dimensional multi-cell lattice-based model that incorporates cell proliferation, apoptosis, necrosis, adhesion, and contractility. We found that the relative rates of cell proliferation and apoptosis governed which of the four morphologies emerged. High proliferation and low apoptosis favored the emergence of solid and comedo morphologies. In contrast, low proliferation and high apoptosis led to the micropapillary morphology, whereas high proliferation and high apoptosis led to the cribriform morphology. The natural progression between morphologies cannot be investigated in vivo since lesions are usually surgically removed upon detection; however, our model suggests probable transitions between these morphologies during breast cancer progression. Importantly, cribriform and comedo appear to be the ultimate morphologies of DCIS. Motivated by previous experimental studies demonstrating that tumor cells behave differently depending on where they are located within the mammary duct in vivo or in engineered tissues, we examined the effects of tissue geometry on the progression of DCIS. In agreement with our previous experimental work, we found that cells are more likely to invade from the end of ducts and that this preferential invasion is regulated by cell adhesion and contractility. This model provides additional insight into tumor cell behavior and allows the exploration of phenotypic transitions not easily monitored in vivo."

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants a JSON object with ontology annotations based on the provided information. The categories must be exact: CellOntology, GeneOntology, MeSH. Each with their respective IDs and terms.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original description. The main subject here is Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), which is a non-invasive breast lesion involving abnormal proliferation of mammary epithelial cells. The model used incorporates processes like cell proliferation, apoptosis, necrosis, adhesion, and contractility. The study also mentions tissue morphology types: micropapillary, cribriform, solid, comedo. They looked at how proliferation and apoptosis rates affect these morphologies. Also, tissue geometry effects, invasion from duct ends regulated by adhesion and contractility.\n\nFor CellOntology: The main cell type mentioned is mammary epithelial cells. So CL term for that. Checking Cell Ontology, \"mammary epithelial cell\" is CL:0002518.\n\nGeneOntology: The processes involved are cell proliferation (GO:0008283), apoptosis (GO:0006915), cell adhesion (GO:0007155), and contractility. Contractility might be under \"actomyosin contractility\" (GO:0031032). Necrosis is mentioned, but the term for necrosis is GO:0070269.\n\nMeSH terms: The disease here is Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (MeSH D018301). Also mentioned are cell proliferation (MeSH D002466), apoptosis (D017209), cell adhesion (D015815), contractility (D003330). Necrosis is D009336.\n\nWait, need to check exact MeSH terms. For example, \"Cell Proliferation\" is D002466, \"Apoptosis\" is D017209, \"Cell Adhesion\" is D015815, \"Necrosis\" is D009336, \"Contractility\" is D003330. Tissue Morphology isn't a MeSH term, but maybe \"Morphogenesis\" D009024? But the text mentions tissue morphologies, but MeSH might not have a direct term. The study uses a model involving these processes, so the MeSH terms would be the processes themselves.\n\nSo compiling all:\n\nCellOntology: Mammary epithelial cells (CL:0002518).\n\nGeneOntology: Cell proliferation (GO:0008283), apoptosis (GO:0006915), cell adhesion (GO:0007155), actomyosin contractility (GO:0031032), necrosis (GO:0070269).\n\nMeSH: Ductal carcinoma in situ (D018301), Cell Proliferation (D002466), Apoptosis (D017209), Cell Adhesion (D015815), Contractility (D003330), Necrosis (D009336).\n\nNeed to ensure the terms are exact. For example, \"Actomyosin contractility\" is the term for GO:0031032. The MeSH terms should match the exact names. Check MeSH terms:\n\n- Ductal Carcinoma in Situ: D018301 (MeSH term is \"Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast\" but the exact term here is Ductal carcinoma in situ. Wait, in MeSH, the entry for DCIS is D018301, and the term is \"Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating\". Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, maybe the user expects the term as \"Ductal carcinoma in situ\" but the actual MeSH term might be different. Wait, looking up MeSH for DCIS: It's \"Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating\" (D018301). But the user might want the term as written in the text. But according to the instructions, the term names must be exact as per the ontology. So if the MeSH term is \"Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating\", then that's what should be used. However, the user provided the example with \"Cell Proliferation\" as the term, which is indeed the MeSH term. So need to verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is okay with the term as \"Ductal carcinoma in situ\" even if the MeSH term is slightly different. But according to the instructions, term names must be exact. So need to check exact MeSH terms.\n\nCheck MeSH for DCIS:\n\nMeSH Unique ID: D018301\nMeSH Heading: Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating\nEntry Terms: DCIS; Ductal Carcinoma in Situ; Intraductal Carcinoma, Noninfiltrating; Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma; Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinomas; Carcinoma in Situ, Ductal; Carcinoma, Ductal, in Situ; Carcinomas, Ductal, in Situ; Ductal Carcinomas in Situ; in Situ, Ductal Carcinomas\n\nSo \"Ductal carcinoma in situ\" is an entry term but the preferred term is \"Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating\". However, the user might expect the term to be as written in the original text. But the instructions say term names must be exact. So perhaps we should use the exact MeSH heading. But this is conflicting. Wait, the example given in the problem uses \"Cell Proliferation\" which is a MeSH term (D002466). Similarly, \"Apoptosis\" is D017209. So in that case, the correct approach is to use the exact MeSH term. Therefore, for DCIS, the MeSH term is \"Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating\". But the user might not want that. Alternatively, perhaps the user is okay with using \"Ductal carcinoma in situ\" as the term because that's how it's referred to in the original text, even if it's an entry term. But according to the problem's instructions, the term must be exact as per the ontology. Therefore, I need to use the exact MeSH term. But this is tricky. Let me check if \"Ductal carcinoma in situ\" is an exact term in MeSH. According to the entry terms, yes, \"Ductal Carcinoma in Situ\" is an entry term. But the exact preferred term is \"Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating\". However, in the example given, the user used \"Cell Proliferation\" which is a preferred term. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the preferred term. But the problem says \"term names must be exact without extra spaces\". So in the original text, they mention \"Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)\", so the term should be \"Ductal carcinoma in situ\". However, in MeSH, the exact term is \"Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating\". But the user might not be aware of this. Since the example given uses \"Cell Proliferation\", which is a direct term, maybe for DCIS, the user expects \"Ductal carcinoma in situ\" as the term, even if it's an entry term. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants the MeSH ID D018301 regardless of the term's exactness. But the problem states that term names must be exact. This is a problem. Maybe I should check the MeSH database.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is lenient here and expects the term as written in the original text. Since the example in the problem used \"Cell Proliferation\" which is a MeSH term (D002466), and \"Cell Proliferation\" is indeed the term. So for DCIS, the correct MeSH term would be \"Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating\" but the user wrote \"Ductal carcinoma in situ\". So perhaps the answer should use the MeSH ID D018301 with the term \"Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating\". However, this might not align with the user's example. Alternatively, maybe the user is okay with using the entry term as the term name. This is a bit ambiguous. Given the instructions, I'll proceed with the exact MeSH term, even if it's not the entry term. But this is a possible error point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is expecting \"Ductal carcinoma in situ\" as the term, even if it's an entry term. Let's assume that the user wants the term as it appears in the original text, as per their example where \"Cell Proliferation\" is used. So for MeSH, the term would be \"Ductal carcinoma in situ\" with ID D018301. But according to MeSH, the entry term is \"Ductal Carcinoma in Situ\" (with capitalization). The problem requires the term to be exact without extra spaces, so perhaps \"Ductal carcinoma in situ\" is acceptable. But I'm not sure. To resolve this, perhaps it's better to use the exact MeSH term. However, given the user's example, they might expect the term as written. So I'll proceed with \"Ductal carcinoma in situ\" as the term, even if it's an entry term, and use the ID D018301.\n\nProceeding with that.\n\nThen, for the other MeSH terms:\n\n- Cell Proliferation: D002466\n- Apoptosis: D017209\n- Cell Adhesion: D015815\n- Contractility: D003330\n- Necrosis: D009336\n\nFor GeneOntology:\n\n- Cell proliferation: GO:0008283 (term: \"cell proliferation\")\n- Apoptosis: GO:0006915 (term: \"apoptotic"
