In contrast, low proliferation and high apoptosis led to the micropapillary morphology, whereas high proliferation and high apoptosis led to the cribriform morphology. The natural progression between morphologies cannot be investigated in vivo since lesions are usually surgically removed upon detection; however, our model suggests probable transitions between these morphologies during breast cancer progression. Importantly, cribriform and comedo appear to be the ultimate morphologies of DCIS. Motivated by previous experimental studies demonstrating that tumor cells behave differently depending on where they are located within the mammary duct in vivo or in engineered tissues, we examined the effects of tissue geometry on the progression of DCIS. In agreement with our previous experimental work, we found that cells are more likely to invade from the end of ducts and that this preferential invasion is regulated by cell adhesion and contractility. This model provides additional insight into tumor cell behavior and allows the exploration of phenotypic transitions not easily monitored in vivo."

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me start by parsing the user's query. They want me to create structured ontology annotations for the provided biological description of Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS) using Cell Ontology, Gene Ontology, and MeSH terms. The key is to return only the JSON object with the exact category names, IDs, and terms as specified.\n\nFirst, I need to identify relevant terms from the text. The original description mentions \"mammary epithelial cells\" proliferating. So for CellOntology, \"Mammary epithelial cell\" should be the term. Checking the Cell Ontology, the correct ID is CL:0002518.\n\nNext, looking at Gene Ontology terms. The model incorporates processes like cell proliferation (GO:0008283), apoptosis (GO:0006915), adhesion (GO:0007155), and contractility. Contractility might be under \"cell contraction\" (GO:0061028). Also, since they're modeling, maybe \"biological process involved in interspecies interaction between organisms\" (GO:0044419) if considering interactions, but the text focuses more on cell behaviors. Necrosis is mentioned, but in the context of the model, apoptosis is the programmed cell death, so GO:0006915 for apoptosis. Adhesion is definitely GO:0007155.\n\nFor MeSH terms, the main topics are Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (D018301), Breast Neoplasms (D001943), Neoplasm Invasiveness (D009362), Cell Proliferation (D049109), and Apoptosis (D017209). Tissue Adhesion (D058589) and Cell Movement (D002465) might also be relevant due to the mention of adhesion and invasion. Contractility isn't directly a MeSH term, but maybe \"Cell Movement\" covers that aspect.\n\nI need to make sure all IDs are correctly formatted without spaces. Double-checking each term's ID:\n\n- CellOntology: CL:0002518 for Mammary epithelial cell.\n- GeneOntology: Proliferation (GO:0008283), Apoptosis (GO:0006915), Adhesion (GO:0007155), and Contractility (GO:0061028).\n- MeSH: DCIS (D018301), Breast Neoplasms (D001943), Neoplasm Invasiveness (D009362), Cell Proliferation (D049109), Apoptosis (D017209), Tissue Adhesion (D058589), and Cell Movement (D002465).\n\nNow, structure the JSON with the exact category names.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a CompuCell3D simulation Python file based on the given ontology annotations. Let me start by recalling the structure of a typical CompuCell3D script. The user specified that the code must include required imports, a simulation class inheriting from SteppableBasePy, and the __init__, start, and step methods. Also, the cell types and parameters should be based on the provided ontology terms.\n\nFirst, the imports. CompuCellSetup is always needed, and the steppables module. So I'll import those.\n\nNext, the simulation class. It should inherit from steppables.SteppableBasePy. The __init__ method needs to call the parent class's __init__. The start method is where we initialize cells, maybe set up the initial layout. The step method will handle actions each simulation step.\n\nLooking at the ontology annotations: the cell type is Mammary epithelial cell. The GeneOntology terms include cell contraction, adhesion, proliferation, apoptosis. MeSH terms include proliferation, movement, carcinoma (like noninfiltrating intraductal), breast neoplasms, tissue adhesion, invasiveness, apoptosis.\n\nSo I need to model cell behaviors like adhesion, proliferation, death (apoptosis), movement, and possibly invasion. In CompuCell3D, adhesion is handled through contact energy in the energy parameters. Proliferation can be done by checking cell volume and dividing. Apoptosis might involve removing cells when certain conditions are met.\n\nIn the start method, I'll create a cluster of cells. Maybe use a blob of mammary cells. Then in the step method, each time step, check for conditions to divide (proliferation) or die (apoptosis).\n\nFor cell types, the main type is MammaryEpithelialCell. But maybe there's also a cancer cell type, given the MeSH terms about carcinoma and neoplasms. Wait, the MeSH terms include \"Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating (D018301)\" and \"Breast Neoplasms\". So perhaps two cell types: normal mammary and carcinoma. But the CellOntology only lists mammary epithelial. Hmm, maybe the user wants the main cell type as mammary, but also introduce a cancerous type for the simulation.\n\nWait, the CellOntology annotation specifies Mammary epithelial cell, but the MeSH terms include carcinoma. So perhaps the simulation involves normal and cancerous cells. But the user didn't specify multiple types. Maybe I should include both. Let me check: the user's ontology includes 'Mammary epithelial cell' as the cell type, but the MeSH terms include carcinoma and breast neoplasms, which might imply the presence of cancerous cells.\n\nSo perhaps two cell types: normal and cancerous. But how to handle that? The user might expect that, but since the CellOntology only lists one type, maybe the main type is mammary, but in the simulation, there could be mutations or transitions to cancerous. Alternatively, maybe the simulation includes both normal and cancer cells from the start.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the simulation models normal cells with potential cancerous behaviors, like increased proliferation or invasiveness. But the code needs to include basic cell types based on the ontology. The CellOntology is CL:0002518, which is mammary epithelial. The MeSH terms include carcinoma, so perhaps another cell type for that.\n\nSo I'll define two cell types: MammaryEpithelialCell and CarcinomaCell. Then, set up their parameters. For adhesion, contact energies between them. Proliferation can be controlled by setting a target volume and having cells divide when they reach a certain volume. Apoptosis would involve cells being removed if certain conditions are met, like a random chance or after a certain time.\n\nIn the start method, create a blob of normal cells and maybe a few carcinoma cells. Then, in the step method, handle proliferation and apoptosis. For cell movement, the contact energies and the flex-based model in CompuCell3D will handle that automatically. For invasion, perhaps the carcinoma cells have lower adhesion, allowing them to spread.\n\nSo, in the XML part (though the user wants Python code, so maybe using the Potts setup in the Python script), set up the basic parameters: dimensions, steps, neighbor order, temperature. Then, define cell types with their properties.\n\nIn the Steppable's start method, create a central blob of normal cells. Then, maybe place a few carcinoma cells. For each step, check if a normal cell should proliferate (maybe based on a probability) and divide. Similarly, carcinoma cells might proliferate more rapidly. Apoptosis could be a random chance each step for any cell.\n\nSo putting this all together:\n\nImports: CompuCellSetup, steppables, and maybe some modules like cc3d.CompuCell for cell death.\n\nIn the simulation class, during __init__, call super and get the cell field. In start, create the initial cells. In step, loop through cells and apply proliferation and apoptosis logic.\n\nWait, the code needs to have basic parameters based on the ontology. So contact energy (adhesion), target volume (for growth), maybe lambda volume for volume constraint.\n\nSo the code outline:\n\n- Import necessary modules.\n- Set up the simulation with CompuCellSetup.\n- Define a steppable class with __init__, start, step.\n- In start, create initial cells.\n- In step, handle cell division and death.\n\nLet me write the code step by step.\n\nFirst, the imports:\n\nfrom cc3d import CompuCellSetup\nfrom cc3d.core.PySteppables import SteppableBasePy, Dimension\n\nThen, the simulation class:\n\nclass SimulationSteppable(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, frequency=1):\n        super().__init__(frequency)\n        self.cell_types = {\n            'MammaryEpithelial': self.MAMMARY,\n            'Carcinoma': self.CARCINOMA\n        }\n\n    def start(self):\n        # Initialize cells\n        # Create a blob of mammary cells\n        self.generate_cell_ids(num_cells=100)  # Not sure about exact method, maybe use a circle?\n        # Alternatively, use CellField to create a cluster\n        mammary_cell = self.potts.createCell()\n        self.cellField[40:60, 40:60, 0] = mammary_cell\n        mammary_cell.type = self.MAMMARY\n        mammary_cell.targetVolume = 25\n        mammary_cell.lambdaVolume = 2.0\n\n        # Add some carcinoma cells\n        carcinoma_cell = self.potts.createCell()\n        self.cellField[30:35, 30:35, 0] = carcinoma_cell\n        carcinoma_cell.type = self.CARCINOMA\n        carcinoma_cell.targetVolume = 25\n        carcinoma_cell.lambdaVolume = 2.0\n\n    def step(self, mcs):\n        # Handle cell proliferation and apoptosis\n        for cell in self.cell_list:\n            if cell.type == self.MAMMARY:\n                # Proliferation chance\n                if mcs % 10 == 0 and cell.volume > cell.targetVolume:\n                    self.divide_cell_orientation_vector_based(cell, 1, 0)\n                # Apoptosis chance\n                if mcs % 50 == 0 and self.random.random() < 0.01:\n                    cell.targetVolume = 0\n            elif cell.type == self.CARCINOMA:\n                # More aggressive proliferation\n                if mcs % 5 == 0 and cell.volume > cell.targetVolume:\n                    self.divide_cell_orientation_vector_based(cell, 1, 0)\n                # Lower apoptosis chance\n                if mcs % 50 == 0 and self.random.random() < 0.001:\n                    cell.targetVolume = 0\n\nBut wait, how are the cell types defined? In CompuCell3D, you usually define cell types in the XML, but since the user wants all in Python, perhaps using the addSteppable and defining the cell types via the API.\n\nAlternatively, in the Python code, cell types can be defined using the CellTypePlugin.\n\nBut maybe in the start method, after initializing the simulation, we need to define the cell types. However, in the Python script, the cell types are usually defined in the XML configuration. But the user wants everything in the Python code.\n\nAlternatively, using the cc3d.CompuCellSetup.register_steppable to set up the simulation.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nIn the Python script, after the imports, define the main function using CompuCellSetup.run(). Then, in the steppable's start method, configure the cell types.\n\nWait, the standard way to set up a simulation in CompuCell3D's Python script is to create a simulation object and add steppables. But perhaps the code should look like this:\n\nfrom cc3d import CompuCellSetup\nfrom cc3d.core.PySteppables import *\n\nclass SimulationSteppable(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, frequency=1):\n        super().__init__(frequency)\n        self.cell_types = None\n\n    def start(self):\n        # Define cell types\n        self.cell_types = {\n            'MammaryEpithelial': self.create_new_cell_type('MammaryEpithelial'),\n            'Carcinoma': self.create_new_cell_type('Carcinoma')\n        }\n\n        # Set up contact energies\n        self.get_xml_element('Plugin"

The model incorporates processes like cell proliferation (GO:0008283), apoptosis (GO:0006915), adhesion (GO:0007155), and contractility. Contractility might be under \"cell contraction\" (GO:0061028). Also, since they're modeling, maybe \"biological process involved in interspecies interaction between organisms\" (GO:0044419) if considering interactions, but the text focuses more on cell behaviors. Necrosis is mentioned, but in the context of the model, apoptosis is the programmed cell death, so GO:0006915 for apoptosis.

Then, in the step method, handle proliferation and apoptosis. For cell movement, the contact energies and the flex-based model in CompuCell3D will handle that automatically. For invasion, perhaps the carcinoma cells have lower adhesion, allowing them to spread.\n\nSo, in the XML part (though the user wants Python code, so maybe using the Potts setup in the Python script), set up the basic parameters: dimensions, steps, neighbor order, temperature. Then, define cell types with their properties.\n\nIn the Steppable's start method, create a central blob of normal cells. Then, maybe place a few carcinoma cells. For each step, check if a normal cell should proliferate (maybe based on a probability) and divide. Similarly, carcinoma cells might proliferate more rapidly. Apoptosis could be a random chance each step for any cell.\n\nSo putting this all together:\n\nImports: CompuCellSetup, steppables, and maybe some modules like cc3d.CompuCell for cell death.\n\nIn the simulation class, during __init__, call super and get the cell field. In start, create the initial cells. In step, loop through cells and apply proliferation and apoptosis logic.\n\nWait, the code needs to have basic parameters based on the ontology. So contact energy (adhesion), target volume (for growth), maybe lambda volume for volume constraint.\n\nSo the code outline:\n\n- Import necessary modules.\n- Set up the simulation with CompuCellSetup.\n- Define a steppable class with __init__, start, step.\n- In start, create initial cells.\n- In step, handle cell division and death.\n\nLet me write the code step by step.\n\nFirst, the imports:\n\nfrom cc3d import CompuCellSetup\nfrom cc3d.core.PySteppables import SteppableBasePy, Dimension\n\nThen, the simulation class:\n\nclass SimulationSteppable(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, frequency=1):\n        super().__init__(frequency)\n        self.cell_types = {\n            'MammaryEpithelial': self.MAMMARY,\n            'Carcinoma': self.CARCINOMA\n        }\n\n    def start(self):\n        # Initialize cells\n        # Create a blob of mammary cells\n        self.generate_cell_ids(num_cells=100)  # Not sure about exact method, maybe use a circle?\n        # Alternatively, use CellField to create a cluster\n        mammary_cell = self.potts.createCell()\n        self.cellField[40:60, 40:60, 0] = mammary_cell\n        mammary_cell.type = self.MAMMARY\n        mammary_cell.targetVolume = 25\n        mammary_cell.lambdaVolume = 2.0\n\n        # Add some carcinoma cells\n        carcinoma_cell = self.potts.createCell()\n        self.cellField[30:35, 30:35, 0] = carcinoma_cell\n        carcinoma_cell.type = self.CARCINOMA\n        carcinoma_cell.targetVolume = 25\n        carcinoma_cell.lambdaVolume = 2.0\n\n    def step(self, mcs):\n        # Handle cell proliferation and apoptosis\n        for cell in self.cell_list:\n            if cell.type == self.MAMMARY:\n                # Proliferation chance\n                if mcs % 10 == 0 and cell.volume > cell.targetVolume:\n                    self.divide_cell_orientation_vector_based(cell, 1, 0)\n                # Apoptosis chance\n                if mcs % 50 == 0 and self.random.random() < 0.01:\n                    cell.targetVolume = 0\n            elif cell.type == self.CARCINOMA:\n                # More aggressive proliferation\n                if mcs % 5 == 0 and cell.volume > cell.targetVolume:\n                    self.divide_cell_orientation_vector_based(cell, 1, 0)\n                # Lower apoptosis chance\n                if mcs % 50 == 0 and self.random.random() < 0.001:\n                    cell.targetVolume = 0\n\nBut wait, how are the cell types defined? In CompuCell3D, you usually define cell types in the XML, but since the user wants all in Python, perhaps using the addSteppable and defining the cell types via the API.\n\nAlternatively, in the Python code, cell types can be defined using the CellTypePlugin.\n\nBut maybe in the start method, after initializing the simulation, we need to define the cell types. However, in the Python script, the cell types are usually defined in the XML configuration. But the user wants everything in the Python code.\n\nAlternatively, using the cc3d.CompuCellSetup.register_steppable to set up the simulation.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nIn the Python script, after the imports, define the main function using CompuCellSetup.run(). Then, in the steppable's start method, configure the cell types.\n\nWait, the standard way to set up a simulation in CompuCell3D's Python script is to create a simulation object and add steppables. But perhaps the code should look like this:\n\nfrom cc3d import CompuCellSetup\nfrom cc3d.core.PySteppables import *\n\nclass SimulationSteppable(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, frequency=1):\n        super().__init__(frequency)\n        self.cell_types = None\n\n    def start(self):\n        # Define cell types\n        self.cell_types = {\n            'MammaryEpithelial': self.create_new_cell_type('MammaryEpithelial'),\n            'Carcinoma': self.create_new_cell_type('Carcinoma')\n        }\n\n        # Set up contact energies\n        self.get_xml_element('Plugin",
