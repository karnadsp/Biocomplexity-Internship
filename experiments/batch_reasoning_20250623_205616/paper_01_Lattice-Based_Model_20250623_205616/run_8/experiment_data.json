        "description": "Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a heterogeneous group of non-invasive lesions of the breast that result from abnormal proliferation of mammary epithelial cells. Pathologists characterize DCIS by four tissue morphologies (micropapillary, cribriform, solid, and comedo), but the underlying mechanisms that distinguish the development and progression of these morphologies are not well understood. Here we explored the conditions leading to the emergence of the different morphologies of DCIS using a two-dimensional multi-cell lattice-based model that incorporates cell proliferation, apoptosis, necrosis, adhesion, and contractility. We found that the relative rates of cell proliferation and apoptosis governed which of the four morphologies emerged. High proliferation and low apoptosis favored the emergence of solid and comedo morphologies. In contrast, low proliferation and high apoptosis led to the micropapillary morphology, whereas high proliferation and high apoptosis led to the cribriform morphology. The natural progression between morphologies cannot be investigated in vivo since lesions are usually surgically removed upon detection; however, our model suggests probable transitions between these morphologies during breast cancer progression. Importantly, cribriform and comedo appear to be the ultimate morphologies of DCIS. Motivated by previous experimental studies demonstrating that tumor cells behave differently depending on where they are located within the mammary duct in vivo or in engineered tissues, we examined the effects of tissue geometry on the progression of DCIS. In agreement with our previous experimental work, we found that cells are more likely to invade from the end of ducts and that this preferential invasion is regulated by cell adhesion and contractility. This model provides additional insight into tumor cell behavior and allows the exploration of phenotypic transitions not easily monitored in vivo."

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to create structured ontology annotations based on the provided description of Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The ontologies needed are CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH, each with specific formatting rules. \n\nFirst, I'll look for Cell Ontology terms. The text mentions \"mammary epithelial cells.\" The Cell Ontology term for mammary epithelial cells is CL:0002519. So that's one entry under CellOntology.\n\nNext, Gene Ontology. The processes mentioned include cell proliferation (GO:0008283), apoptosis (GO:0006915), adhesion (GO:0007155), and contractility. Contractility might be part of cell-matrix adhesion (GO:0007160) or muscle contraction, but since it's about cells, maybe cell-substrate adhesion (GO:0031589). Wait, the model includes adhesion and contractility. Looking up, cell adhesion is GO:0007155, and contractility could relate to actin filament-based process, but perhaps more specifically, cell contractility might be under GO:0030029 (actin filament-based process). Alternatively, maybe cell motility. Hmm. The text also mentions cell proliferation and apoptosis. So definitely include GO:0008283 (cell proliferation), GO:0006915 (apoptotic process). For adhesion, GO:0007155 (cell adhesion). Contractility might be a stretch; maybe GO:0006936 (muscle contraction), but that's for muscle cells. Alternatively, perhaps \"cell migration\" (GO:0016477), but the text talks about contractility in the context of invasion. Alternatively, cell motility (GO:0048870). Alternatively, looking up \"contractility\" in GO, I find \"actomyosin contractile ring assembly\" (GO:0043256), but that's specific to cytokinesis. Maybe \"cell contraction\" (GO:0006937). Alternatively, perhaps the user refers to cell contractility as part of adhesion, so maybe stick with adhesion terms. Wait, the model incorporates adhesion and contractility. Since contractility isn't directly a GO term, maybe focus on the ones explicitly mentioned: proliferation, apoptosis, adhesion, necrosis. Necrosis is GO:0070269 (necrotic cell death). So adding that. So GO terms would be cell proliferation (GO:0008283), apoptotic process (GO:0006915), cell adhesion (GO:0007155), and necrotic cell death (GO:0070269).\n\nFor MeSH terms, the main topics are Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (MeSH D018301), Breast Neoplasms (D001943), Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (D059368), Cell Proliferation (D049109), Apoptosis (D017209), and maybe Necrosis (D009336). Also, Cell Adhesion (D015815), Contractility might be under Muscle Contraction (D009120), but since it's about cells in general, perhaps Cell Movement (D002465) or Extracellular Matrix (D005109). Alternatively, check if \"cell contractility\" is a MeSH term. Searching MeSH, \"Cell Movement\" is D002465. Contractility isn't a direct term, but \"Cell Adhesion\" and \"Muscle Contraction\" exist. The text mentions invasion, so maybe Neoplasm Invasiveness (D009361). But the user mentioned \"adhesion and contractility\" affecting invasion. So MeSH terms could include Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (D018301), Breast Neoplasms (D001943), Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (D059368), Cell Proliferation (D049109), Apoptosis (D017209), Necrosis (D009336), Cell Adhesion (D015815), and Neoplasm Invasiveness (D009361). \n\nNeed to make sure all terms are exact. For example, \"Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition\" is the exact term. \"Ductal carcinoma in situ\" maps to MeSH term \"Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast\" which is D018301. Wait, checking MeSH: \"Ductal Carcinoma in Situ\" is D018301. Yes. \"Breast Neoplasms\" is D001943. Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition is D059368. Cell Proliferation is D049109. Apoptosis is D017209. Necrosis is D009336. Cell Adhesion is D015815. Neoplasm Invasiveness is D009361. Contractility isn't a MeSH term, so maybe exclude that and focus on the others mentioned.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have each category with the correct IDs and terms. Check formatting: no extra spaces in IDs, exact category names. For example, \"GeneOntology\" not \"Gene Ontology\". \n\nSo CellOntology has CL:0002519 (mammary epithelial cell). GeneOntology includes terms for proliferation (GO:0008283), apoptosis (GO:0006915), adhesion (GO:0007155), necrosis (GO:0070269). MeSH includes D018301 (DCIS), D001943 (Breast Neoplasms), D059368 (Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition), D049109 (Cell Proliferation), D017209 (Apoptosis), D009336 (Necrosis), D015815 (Cell Adhesion), D009361 (Neoplasm Invasiveness).\n\nCheck if all terms are exact. \"Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition\" is correct in MeSH. \"Necrosis\" in MeSH is D009336. Yes. Cell Adhesion is D015815. Neoplasm Invasiveness is D009361.\n\nThat should cover all the relevant terms from the text. Now structure the JSON accordingly.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0002519\",\n            \"term\": \"mammary epithelial cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0008283\",\n            \"term\": \"cell proliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0006915\",\n            \"term\": \"apoptotic process\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007155\",\n            \"term\": \"cell adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0070269\",\n            \"term\": \"necrotic cell death\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D018301\",\n            \"term\": \"Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D001943\",\n            \"term\": \"Breast Neoplasms\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D059368\",\n            \"term\": \"Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D049109\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Proliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D017209\",\n            \"term\": \"Apoptosis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D009336\",\n            \"term\": \"Necrosis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D015815\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D009361\",\n            \"term\": \"Neoplasm Invasiveness\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"
