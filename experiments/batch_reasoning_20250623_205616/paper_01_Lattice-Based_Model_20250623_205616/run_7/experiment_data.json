        "description": "Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a heterogeneous group of non-invasive lesions of the breast that result from abnormal proliferation of mammary epithelial cells. Pathologists characterize DCIS by four tissue morphologies (micropapillary, cribriform, solid, and comedo), but the underlying mechanisms that distinguish the development and progression of these morphologies are not well understood. Here we explored the conditions leading to the emergence of the different morphologies of DCIS using a two-dimensional multi-cell lattice-based model that incorporates cell proliferation, apoptosis, necrosis, adhesion, and contractility. We found that the relative rates of cell proliferation and apoptosis governed which of the four morphologies emerged. High proliferation and low apoptosis favored the emergence of solid and comedo morphologies. In contrast, low proliferation and high apoptosis led to the micropapillary morphology, whereas high proliferation and high apoptosis led to the cribriform morphology. The natural progression between morphologies cannot be investigated in vivo since lesions are usually surgically removed upon detection; however, our model suggests probable transitions between these morphologies during breast cancer progression. Importantly, cribriform and comedo appear to be the ultimate morphologies of DCIS. Motivated by previous experimental studies demonstrating that tumor cells behave differently depending on where they are located within the mammary duct in vivo or in engineered tissues, we examined the effects of tissue geometry on the progression of DCIS. In agreement with our previous experimental work, we found that cells are more likely to invade from the end of ducts and that this preferential invasion is regulated by cell adhesion and contractility. This model provides additional insight into tumor cell behavior and allows the exploration of phenotypic transitions not easily monitored in vivo."

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by parsing the original description to identify relevant terms for each ontology. The user wants annotations for CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH.\n\nFirst, CellOntology. The text mentions \"mammary epithelial cells\". Checking the Cell Ontology, the term for mammary epithelial cells is CL:0002492. So that's one entry. Also, DCIS is about non-invasive lesions, but maybe other cell types? The model uses a multi-cell lattice, but the main cell type here is epithelial. So CL:0000066 for epithelial cell? Wait, the example used \"Epithelial\" as the term, but the correct term might be \"epithelial cell\". Need to check. The user specified exact term names, so I should verify. CL:0000066 is \"epithelial cell\". So perhaps both CL:0002492 (mammary epithelial cell) and CL:0000066 (epithelial cell) are applicable. But the original text specifically mentions mammary epithelial cells, so maybe just CL:0002492. Wait, but the model is about their proliferation and behavior, so maybe epithelial cell in general is also relevant. Hmm. Let me check the CL. CL:0002492 is \"mammary gland epithelial cell\", which is more specific. The text says \"abnormal proliferation of mammary epithelial cells\", so the specific term would be better. So include CL:0002492 with term \"mammary gland epithelial cell\".\n\nNext, GeneOntology. The model incorporates processes like cell proliferation (GO:0008283), apoptosis (GO:0006915), adhesion (GO:0007155), and contractility. Contractility might relate to cell contraction (GO:0006928). Also, necrosis (GO:0070269). The text mentions these processes, so each should be a GO term. So five terms: cell proliferation (GO:0008283), apoptosis (GO:0006915), cell adhesion (GO:0007155), cell contraction (GO:0006928), and necrotic cell death (GO:0070269). Need exact term names. For example, apoptosis is \"apoptotic process\" in GO. Let me confirm. Yes, GO:0006915 is \"apoptotic process\". Cell adhesion is \"cell adhesion\" (GO:0007155). Cell contraction is \"cell contraction\" (GO:0006928). Necrosis is \"necrotic cell death\" (GO:0070269). Proliferation is \"cell proliferation\" (GO:0008283). So those five terms.\n\nMeSH terms. The main topics here are ductal carcinoma in situ (MeSH D018301), breast neoplasms (D001943), neoplasm invasiveness (D009362), and maybe cell adhesion (D015815) or cell movement (D002465). The text discusses DCIS, breast cancer progression, invasion, and mentions adhesion and contractility. MeSH terms for DCIS is D018301. Breast neoplasms is D001943. Neoplasm invasiveness is D009362. Also, cell adhesion (D015815) and cell movement (D002465) might be relevant. Additionally, tissue engineering is mentioned, which is D057749. The model uses a lattice-based model, which might relate to computer simulation (D003198), but the user might not include that. Focus on the main disease terms and processes. So DCIS (D018301), Breast Neoplasms (D001943), Neoplasm Invasiveness (D009362), Cell Adhesion (D015815), and Cell Movement (D002465). Check MeSH terms for these. Yes, D018301 is \"Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating\", which is DCIS. D001943 is \"Breast Neoplasms\". D009362 is \"Neoplasm Invasiveness\". D015815 is \"Cell Adhesion\", and D002465 is \"Cell Movement\". Also, \"apoptosis\" is MeSH D017209, but since apoptosis is covered in GO, maybe not necessary here unless the text emphasizes it. The original text mentions apoptosis as a key factor, so perhaps include D017209. But the user wants MeSH terms where applicable. Let me check if \"Apoptosis\" is a MeSH term: Yes, D017209. So including that. So MeSH terms: DCIS, Breast Neoplasms, Neoplasm Invasiveness, Apoptosis, Cell Adhesion, Cell Movement. Wait, contractility isn't a MeSH term, but maybe \"Cell Movement\" covers that aspect. Alternatively, \"Cell Contraction\" is D044464. Let me check. MeSH term for cell contraction is D044464. So if the model includes contractility, perhaps that's relevant. But the user may prioritize terms explicitly mentioned. The text says \"adhesion and contractility\", so contractility as a process. MeSH has \"Cell Contraction\" (D044464). So include that. So MeSH terms would be: D018301 (Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating), D001943 (Breast Neoplasms), D009362 (Neoplasm Invasiveness), D017209 (Apoptosis), D015815 (Cell Adhesion), D044464 (Cell Contraction). \n\nWait, the user's example includes \"Cell Proliferation\" as a MeSH term. But in MeSH, \"Cell Proliferation\" is D049109. The text does mention cell proliferation as a key factor, so maybe include that. So adding D049109 (Cell Proliferation) to MeSH. So MeSH terms would be: DCIS, Breast Neoplasms, Neoplasm Invasiveness, Apoptosis, Cell Adhesion, Cell Contraction, Cell Proliferation. Let me confirm MeSH IDs:\n\n- Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating: D018301\n- Breast Neoplasms: D001943\n- Neoplasm Invasiveness: D009362\n- Apoptosis: D017209\n- Cell Adhesion: D015815\n- Cell Contraction: D044464\n- Cell Proliferation: D049109\n\nYes. So seven MeSH terms.\n\nNow, structuring all into JSON as per the example. Need exact category names and IDs without spaces. Also, term names must be exact. For example, \"mammary gland epithelial cell\" (CL:0002492), \"epithelial cell\" (CL:0000066). Wait, the original text mentions \"mammary epithelial cells\" but the exact term in Cell Ontology is \"mammary gland epithelial cell\". So include that. The model also refers to epithelial cells in general? Maybe, but the text specifically says mammary. So perhaps only CL:0002492. But in the example, \"Epithelial\" was used, but the actual term is \"epithelial cell\". Wait, in the user's example, the term was \"Epithelial\" but the correct term is \"epithelial cell\". However, the user's example might have been simplified. But in reality, the correct term for CL:0000066 is \"epithelial cell\". However, the original text refers to \"mammary epithelial cells\", so CL:0002492 is more accurate. So CellOntology should have CL:0002492 with term \"mammary gland epithelial cell\".\n\nWait, the example given by the user had \"Epithelial\" as the term, but in reality, the CL terms use \"epithelial cell\". So the user might have made a simplification. But the user's instructions say to use exact term names. So for mammary epithelial cells, the exact term is \"mammary gland epithelial cell\" (CL:0002492). So that's one entry. Are there other cell types? The text mentions necrosis and apoptosis, but those are processes, not cell types. The model uses a multi-cell lattice, but the main cell type is epithelial. So CellOntology would have CL:0002492.\n\nGeneOntology terms: cell proliferation (GO:0008283), apoptotic process (GO:0006915), cell adhesion (GO:0007155), cell contraction (GO:0006928), necrotic cell death (GO:0070269). These are all the processes mentioned in the model. So five entries.\n\nMeSH terms: D018301 (Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating), D001943 (Breast Neoplasms), D009362 (Neoplasm Invasiveness), D017209 (Apoptosis), D015815 (Cell Adhesion), D044464 (Cell Contraction), D049109 (Cell Proliferation). So seven entries.\n\nNow, check if all IDs are correctly formatted without spaces. For example, CL:0002492, GO:0008283, D018301, etc. Yes.\n\nSo the JSON should be structured with these entries. Let me put it all together.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0002492\",\n            \"term\": \"mammary gland epithelial cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0008283\",\n            \"term\": \"cell proliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0006915\",\n            \"term\": \"apoptotic process\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007155\",\n            \"term\": \"cell adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0006928\",\n            \"term"
