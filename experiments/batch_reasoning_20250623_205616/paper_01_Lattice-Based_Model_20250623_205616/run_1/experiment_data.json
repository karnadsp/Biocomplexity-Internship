Pathologists characterize DCIS by four tissue morphologies (micropapillary, cribriform, solid, and comedo), but the underlying mechanisms that distinguish the development and progression of these morphologies are not well understood. Here we explored the conditions leading to the emergence of the different morphologies of DCIS using a two-dimensional multi-cell lattice-based model that incorporates cell proliferation, apoptosis, necrosis, adhesion, and contractility. We found that the relative rates of cell proliferation and apoptosis governed which of the four morphologies emerged. High proliferation and low apoptosis favored the emergence of solid and comedo morphologies. In contrast, low proliferation and high apoptosis led to the micropapillary morphology, whereas high proliferation and high apoptosis led to the cribriform morphology. The natural progression between morphologies cannot be investigated in vivo since lesions are usually surgically removed upon detection; however, our model suggests probable transitions between these morphologies during breast cancer progression. Importantly, cribriform and comedo appear to be the ultimate morphologies of DCIS. Motivated by previous experimental studies demonstrating that tumor cells behave differently depending on where they are located within the mammary duct in vivo or in engineered tissues, we examined the effects of tissue geometry on the progression of DCIS. In agreement with our previous experimental work, we found that cells are more likely to invade from the end of ducts and that this preferential invasion is regulated by cell adhesion and contractility.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me start by understanding the task. The user wants me to create a JSON object with ontology annotations for the provided description of Ductal Carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The ontologies needed are CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH. Each category must have exact names, IDs without spaces, and terms without extra spaces.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the original description to identify relevant terms. The text mentions \"mammary epithelial cells\" which points to Cell Ontology. The Cell Ontology term for mammary epithelial cells is CL:0002492. So I'll add that under CellOntology.\n\nNext, looking at the processes involved: cell proliferation, apoptosis, necrosis, adhesion, contractility. For Gene Ontology (GO), cell proliferation is GO:0008283, apoptosis is GO:0006915, cell adhesion is GO:0007155, and contractility might relate to cell contraction, which is GO:0006936. Also, necrosis is mentioned, but in GO, programmed necrotic cell death is GO:0097300. However, the description might refer to necrosis generally, so I need to check. The exact term for \"necrotic cell death\" is GO:0070265. I'll include these GO terms.\n\nFor MeSH terms, the main topics here are Ductal Carcinoma in situ, which is MeSH D018301. Also, breast neoplasms (MeSH D001943), cell proliferation (MeSH D049109), apoptosis (MeSH D017209), and cell adhesion (MeSH D015815). The mention of tissue geometry might relate to \"Tissue Engineering\" (MeSH D020258) since the model is inspired by engineered tissues. Additionally, \"Neoplasm Invasiveness\" (MeSH D009361) is relevant because the model discusses invasion from duct ends.\n\nI need to ensure all IDs are correctly formatted without spaces. Let me verify each term's ID:\n\n- CellOntology: \"CL:0002492\" for mammary epithelial cell.\n- GeneOntology: \n  - Cell proliferation: GO:0008283\n  - Apoptotic process: GO:0006915\n  - Cell adhesion: GO:0007155\n  - Necrotic cell death: GO:0070265\n  - Cell contraction: GO:0006936\n- MeSH:\n  - Ductal Carcinoma in situ: D018301\n  - Breast neoplasms: D001943\n  - Cell proliferation: D049109\n  - Apoptosis: D017209\n  - Cell adhesion: D015815\n  - Tissue Engineering: D020258\n  - Neoplasm Invasiveness: D009361\n\nCheck term names for exactness. \"Mammary Epithelial Cell\" should be the term name from Cell Ontology. For GO terms, the exact names are \"cell proliferation\", \"apoptotic process\", \"cell adhesion\", \"necrotic cell death\", and \"cell contraction\". MeSH terms are as listed.\n\nNow, structure the JSON with the categories exactly named as specified. Each entry should have \"id\" and \"term\". Ensure there are no trailing spaces or formatting issues. No explanations, just the JSON.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0002492\",\n            \"term\": \"Mammary Epithelial Cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0008283\",\n            \"term\": \"cell proliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0006915\",\n            \"term\": \"apoptotic process\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007155\",\n            \"term\": \"cell adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0070265\",\n            \"term\": \"necrotic cell death\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0006936\",\n            \"term\": \"cell contraction\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D018301\",\n            \"term\": \"Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D001943\",\n            \"term\": \"Breast Neoplasms\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D049109\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Proliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D017209\",\n            \"term\": \"Apoptosis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D015815\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D020258\",\n            \"term\": \"Tissue Engineering\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D009361\",\n            \"term\": \"Neoplasm Invasiveness\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out how to generate the CompuCell3D simulation file based on the given ontology annotations. The user wants a Python script that includes specific elements: necessary imports, a simulation class inheriting from SteppableBasePy, required methods (__init__, start, step), and basic cell types and parameters related to the provided ontologies.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the structure of a typical CompuCell3D simulation script. The main components are the imports, the setup of the simulation, defining cell types, and the steppable classes that control the simulation behavior.\n\nThe ontology annotations mention Mammary Epithelial Cells, so the cell types should include that. The Gene Ontology terms include processes like necrotic cell death, apoptosis, cell adhesion, proliferation, contraction. MeSH terms relate to apoptosis, neoplasm invasiveness, breast neoplasms, etc. These suggest that the simulation might involve cell adhesion, proliferation, death (both apoptotic and necrotic), and possibly mechanical properties like contraction.\n\nStarting with the imports: CompuCellSetup is needed to run the simulation. From the steppables module, we'll need SteppableBasePy. Also, the cc3d module for core elements like cell death parameters.\n\nNext, the simulation class. It should inherit from SteppableBasePy. In the __init__ method, call the parent's __init__. The start method is where we initialize cells, maybe set up the initial configuration. The step method will handle processes that occur each simulation step.\n\nFor cell types, the main type here is Mammary Epithelial. Maybe also define a default type for other cells. Each cell type will have parameters related to the ontology terms. For example, apoptosis and necrosis can be handled with target volume and parameters for necrosis. Cell adhesion is managed through contact energy in the Potts model. Proliferation might involve checking cell volume to decide division. Contraction could relate to the lambda volume parameter, affecting cell elasticity.\n\nIn the start method, set up the initial cell. Maybe create a blob of epithelial cells. Use the CellField to access the grid and assign cells. Also, set up the Potts parameters: dimensions, steps, neighbor order, temperature (fluctuation amplitude).\n\nIn the step method, at each MC step, check each cell's volume. If it's larger than a threshold, divide. Also, check for apoptosis (maybe by some probability) or necrosis (if volume is too low). For contraction, adjust the target volume or lambda to simulate contraction.\n\nContact energies between cells are important for adhesion. Epithelial cells should adhere more to each other than to medium, so set lower contact energy for same type.\n\nAlso, need to register the steppable with CompuCellSetup. The main function initializes the simulation, registers the steppable, and runs it.\n\nWait, in CompuCell3D, contact energy is set in the XML or via the plugin. But since the user wants everything in Python, maybe they use the Contact plugin. However, in the code example, the user might set contact energy using the contactEnergy property in the dictionary. For example, self.cellTypeContactEnergy.\n\nPutting it all together: import necessary modules, define the simulation class with init, start, step. In start, configure cell types and their parameters. Initialize the cell field. In step, handle proliferation (cell division), apoptosis, necrosis. Set contact energies. Then register the steppable and run.\n\nTesting for possible errors: ensure all required methods are present, correct inheritance, and parameters are set properly based on ontology terms. For example, apoptosis and necrosis are part of cell death, so need to set appropriate volume thresholds or death rates.\n\nAlso, the MeSH terms include Neoplasm Invasiveness and Carcinoma, which might relate to cell migration or invasion. But since the user didn't specify, maybe just include basic adhesion and death parameters.\n\nIn the code, the cell types are defined with addType. The Potts setup is in the start method. The step method iterates over cells, checks volume for division, and checks for apoptosis (maybe a random chance each step) and necrosis (if volume is below a threshold). The contact energies are set between cell types to handle adhesion.\n\nI think that's the approach. Now, structure the code accordingly, making sure to include all required elements and map the ontology terms to simulation parameters.\n</think>\n\n```python\nimport CompuCellSetup\nfrom PySteppables import SteppableBasePy\nimport cc3d\n\nclass SimulationSteppable(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, simulator, frequency=1):\n        super().__init__(simulator, frequency)\n        self.invasion_strength = 0.5\n        self.apoptosis_prob = 0.001\n        self.necrosis_threshold = 15\n        \n    def start(self):\n        self.configure_cell_types()\n        self.initialize_cells()\n        self.setup_contact_energies()\n        self.prepare_apoptosis_necrosis()\n        \n    def configure_cell_types(self):\n        self.cell_types = {\n            'MammaryEpithelial': self.addCellType(\"MammaryEpithelial\"),\n            'Medium': self.addCellType(\"Medium\")\n        }\n        \n    def initialize_cells(self):\n        for x, y, z in self.every_pixel():\n            if self.is_initial_region(x, y, z):\n                cell = self.create_new_cell(self.cell_types['MammaryEpithelial'])\n                self.cellField[x, y, z] = cell\n                self.set_cell_parameters(cell)\n                \n    def setup_contact_energies(self):\n        self.contactEnergy = {\n            'MammaryEpithelial,MammaryEpithelial': 10,\n            'MammaryEpithelial,Medium': 22\n        }\n        \n    def prepare_apoptosis_necrosis(self):\n        for cell in self.cell_list:\n            cell.targetVolume = 25\n            cell.lambdaVolume = 2.0\n            cell['Apoptosis'] = False\n            cell['Necrosis'] = False\n            \n    def step(self, mcs):\n        for cell in self.cell_list:\n            if cell.type == self.cell_types['MammaryEpithelial']:\n                self.handle_proliferation(cell)\n                self.handle_death_processes(cell)\n                self.handle_contraction(cell)\n                \n    def handle_proliferation(self, cell):\n        if cell.volume > 32:\n            self.divide_cell_random_orientation(cell)\n            \n    def handle_death_processes(self, cell):\n        if self.random() < self.apoptosis_prob:\n            cell.targetVolume = 0\n            cell['Apoptosis'] = True\n        if cell.volume < self.necrosis_threshold and not cell['Apoptosis']:\n            cell['Necrosis'] = True\n            cell.lambdaVolume *= 0.5\n            \n    def handle_contraction(self, cell):\n        if mcs % 100 == 0 and cell['Necrosis']:\n            cell.targetVolume *= 0.95\n            \n    def is_initial_region(self, x, y, z):\n        return 20 < x < 80 and 20 < y < 80 and z == 0\n        \n    def set_cell_parameters(self, cell):\n        cell.targetVolume = 25\n        cell.lambdaVolume = 2.0\n        cell['Apoptosis'] = False\n        cell['Necrosis'] = False\n\nCompuCellSetup.register_steppable(steppable=SimulationSteppable(frequency=1))\nCompuCellSetup.run()\n```"
