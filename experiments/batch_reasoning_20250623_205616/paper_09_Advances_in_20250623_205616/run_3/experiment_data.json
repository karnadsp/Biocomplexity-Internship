      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by breaking down the original description. The paper is about Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) simulations using a cellular Potts model. They look at 2D migration and 3D invasion into collagen gel. \n\nFirst, for CellOntology. The main cells involved are epithelial and mesenchymal. So I need to find the correct CL IDs. Epithelial cells are CL:0000066, and mesenchymal cells might be CL:0008019. Let me confirm that. Yes, mesenchymal cell is CL:0008019.\n\nNext, GeneOntology. The processes mentioned include cell migration (GO:0016477), cell adhesion (GO:0007155), and maybe cell invasion. But GO doesn't have a specific term for invasion, so perhaps cell motility (GO:0048870) or locomotion. Also, the paper talks about adhesion, so terms like \"cell-cell adhesion\" (GO:0098609) and \"cell-matrix adhesion\" (GO:0007160) might be relevant. The cellular component could be collagen-containing extracellular matrix (GO:0062023). Biological processes involved in EMT would be epithelial to mesenchymal transition (GO:0001837). Also, cell division isn't mentioned here, so maybe not include that.\n\nFor MeSH terms, EMT is covered under \"Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition\" (D057885). Cell movement is \"Cell Movement\" (D002465), and collagen gel would relate to \"Collagen\" (D003094). Also, \"Cell Adhesion\" (D015815) is a MeSH term. The model used is \"Models, Biological\" (D008954). \n\nNow, making sure all the IDs are correctly formatted without spaces. Check each term's exact name. For example, \"Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition\" in MeSH. Also, confirm the CL terms: \"Epithelial Cell\" and \"Mesenchymal Cell\". In GO, \"epithelial to mesenchymal transition\" is the term, and \"collagen-containing extracellular matrix\".\n\nWait, in the example, the GeneOntology terms have the term \"Cell Division\" with a space, so the terms here should follow the exact names. For instance, \"cell migration\" in GO is \"Cell Migration\", so I need to check the exact term names. Let me verify:\n\n- GO:0001837 is \"epithelial to mesenchymal transition\" (term name is lowercase in GO? Wait no, in the GO, the actual term is \"epithelial to mesenchymal transition\" but the display name might have different capitalization. But according to the user's example, \"Cell Division\" is capitalized. So perhaps the terms should be in the exact case as per the ontology. However, checking the GO database, \"epithelial to mesenchymal transition\" is the correct term with lowercase except proper nouns. Wait, no, GO terms are generally capitalized. Let me check. For example, GO:0001837 is \"epithelial to mesenchymal transition\" in some sources but others might have it capitalized. Hmm, maybe I should confirm. Alternatively, maybe the user expects the term as per standard presentation. Alternatively, perhaps the example given by the user has \"Cell Division\" with initial caps, so following that, maybe the terms should be in title case. But this could be a point of confusion. \n\nAlternatively, check the actual GO term for \"epithelial to mesenchymal transition\". According to the Gene Ontology browser, the term is \"epithelial to mesenchymal transition\" (GO:0001837), and the term name is in lowercase except EMT. Wait, no, actually, in the GO, terms are generally in lowercase except proper nouns. So \"epithelial to mesenchymal transition\" is correct. But the user's example has \"Cell Division\" with initial caps, which is not the standard in GO. Hmm, maybe the user expects the terms to be capitalized as in the example. Wait, the user's instructions say: \"Term names must be exact without extra spaces\". So I need to use the exact term names as per the ontology. Therefore, need to check the exact term name for each ID.\n\nFor example, GO:0001837 is \"epithelial to mesenchymal transition\" (all lowercase except transition? Wait, checking the GO entry: the term is \"epithelial to mesenchymal transition\" (yes, lowercase). So that's the exact term. But in the user's example, they have \"Cell Division\" (capitalized). Wait, the example might not be accurate. Wait, in the GO, \"cell division\" is the term (GO:0051301), but in the example, it's written as \"Cell Division\". So perhaps the user is expecting title case regardless of the actual term. But the instructions say \"Term names must be exact without extra spaces\". So I should use the exact term as per the ontology. Therefore, \"epithelial to mesenchymal transition\" is lowercase, \"cell migration\" is lowercase. But in the example, the user wrote \"Cell Division\" with capitals. That's conflicting. Wait, perhaps the example is incorrect. But according to the user's instructions, the terms must be exact. So perhaps in reality, \"cell division\" is the correct term, but the example in their message uses \"Cell Division\". This is a problem. \n\nWait, let me check. If I look up \"cell division\" in GO, the term is \"cell division\" (GO:0051301), with lowercase. But the user's example shows \"Cell Division\" as the term. So there's a discrepancy here. Therefore, the user might have made a mistake in the example. But according to their instructions, we need to use the exact term as per the ontology. Therefore, for the current task, I should use the exact term names as they are in the ontologies, even if the example shows differently. However, the user's example shows \"Cell Division\" which is not correct. But perhaps the user expects title case. This is a problem. Since the user is the one setting the requirements, maybe they want the terms as per the example's style. But given the instructions say \"exact term names\", perhaps it's better to check the actual terms.\n\nBut since I can't access external resources right now, maybe I should proceed with the standard capitalization. For example, \"epithelial to mesenchymal transition\" (lowercase), \"cell migration\", \"cell adhesion\", etc. But the example uses \"Cell Division\" with capitals, so maybe the user expects the terms to be in title case. Alternatively, maybe the user's example is wrong, but we have to follow the instructions. \n\nThis is a bit of a quandary, but given the user's example, perhaps they want the terms in title case regardless. However, that's risky. Alternatively, perhaps they just want the terms as per their example, even if that's not technically accurate. For the purposes of this task, given that the user provided the example with \"Cell Division\", maybe the terms should be in title case. But without knowing, it's hard. To resolve this, perhaps check the most common way these terms are presented. For example:\n\n- Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) is often capitalized in titles but in GO it's lowercase. So the exact term is \"epithelial to mesenchymal transition\". But in the user's example, \"Cell Division\" is written with capitals. So conflicting instructions. Since the user says to follow term names exactly, perhaps we need to use the exact term as per the ontology. But since I can't check right now, maybe proceed with the standard. Alternatively, use title case as in the example. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's example is a mistake, and the correct terms should be in lowercase. For example, in GO, \"cell division\" is the term. So in the example, it's a typo. Therefore, the correct approach is to use the exact term names as per the ontology. So for GO:0001837, the term is \"epithelial to mesenchymal transition\". For cell migration, it's \"cell migration\" (GO:0016477). For cell adhesion, \"cell adhesion\" (GO:0007155). Collagen-containing extracellular matrix (GO:0062023). \n\nFor MeSH terms, \"Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition\" (D057885), \"Cell Movement\" (D002465), \"Collagen\" (D003094), \"Cell Adhesion\" (D015815), \"Models, Biological\" (D008954). \n\nSo putting this all together:\n\nCellOntology would have Epithelial cell (CL:0000066) and Mesenchymal cell (CL:0008019).\n\nGeneOntology would have epithelial to mesenchymal transition (GO:0001837), cell migration (GO:0016477), cell adhesion (GO:0007155), collagen-containing extracellular matrix (GO:0062023), maybe cell-matrix adhesion (GO:0007160), and cell-cell adhesion (GO:0098609).\n\nMeSH terms: Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (D057885), Cell Movement (D002465), Collagen (D003094), Cell Adhesion (D015815), Models, Biological (D008954).\n\nCheck if the original text mentions cell-cell adhesion loss and cell-matrix adhesion gain. The model talks about loss of endocardial adhesion (maybe cell-cell adhesion) and gain in adhesion to collagen gel (cell-matrix). So include terms like \"cell-cell adhesion\" and \"cell-matrix adhesion\".\n\nAlso, the model uses cellular Potts model, which is a type of biological model. So MeSH term \"Models, Biological\" (D008954).\n\nSo the"
