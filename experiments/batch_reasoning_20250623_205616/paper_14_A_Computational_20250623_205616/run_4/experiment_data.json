        "description": "Vascular development is a complex process regulated by dynamic biological networks that vary in topology and state across different tissues and developmental stages. Signals regulating de novo blood vessel formation (vasculogenesis) and remodeling (angiogenesis) come from a variety of biological pathways linked to endothelial cell (EC) behavior, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and the local generation of chemokines and growth factors. Simulating these interactions at a systems level requires sufficient biological detail about the relevant molecular pathways and associated cellular behaviors, and tractable computational models that offset mathematical and biological complexity. Here, we describe a novel multicellular agent-based model of vasculogenesis using the CompuCell3D (http://www.compucell3d.org/) modeling environment supplemented with semi-automatic knowledgebase creation. The model incorporates vascular endothelial growth factor signals, pro- and anti-angiogenic inflammatory chemokine signals, and the plasminogen activating system of enzymes and proteases linked to ECM interactions, to simulate nascent EC organization, growth and remodeling. The model was shown to recapitulate stereotypical capillary plexus formation and structural emergence of non-coded cellular behaviors, such as a heterologous bridging phenomenon linking endothelial tip cells together during formation of polygonal endothelial cords. Molecular targets in the computational model were mapped to signatures of vascular disruption derived from in vitro chemical profiling using the EPA's ToxCast high-throughput screening (HTS) dataset. Simulating the HTS data with the cell-agent based model of vascular development predicted adverse effects of a reference anti-angiogenic thalidomide analog, 5HPP-33, on in vitro angiogenesis with respect to both concentration-response and morphological consequences. These findings support the utility of cell agent-based models for simulating a morphogenetic series of events and for the first time demonstrate the applicability of these models for predictive toxicology."

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's break down the user's request. They want a structured JSON object with ontology annotations from Cell Ontology, Gene Ontology, and MeSH based on the provided text. The key is to extract relevant terms and their exact IDs from each ontology.\n\nFirst, looking at the original description, terms related to cells mentioned include endothelial cells (ECs). So for CellOntology, I need to find the correct CL ID for endothelial cells. Checking the Cell Ontology, the term \"endothelial cell\" is CL:0000115.\n\nNext, Gene Ontology terms. The text talks about vasculogenesis (GO:0001570), angiogenesis (GO:0001525), extracellular matrix remodeling (GO:0030198), and cell proliferation (GO:0008283). These are all biological processes mentioned in the document.\n\nFor MeSH terms, the relevant concepts are vascular endothelial growth factors (D000094262), extracellular matrix (D005109), plasminogen activators (D010957), and angiogenesis (D000096362). I need to ensure the MeSH IDs are correctly formatted without spaces. Wait, MeSH IDs for some terms might have different formats. For example, \"Angiogenesis\" is D000096362, \"Extracellular Matrix\" is D005109, \"Plasminogen Activators\" is D010957, and \"Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors\" is D000094262. I should verify each ID to make sure they're accurate.\n\nAlso, need to ensure the category names are exact: \"CellOntology\", \"GeneOntology\", \"MeSH\". No extra spaces in term names. IDs must be exact without spaces. Let me double-check each term and ID to avoid any formatting issues. For instance, \"endothelial cell\" in CellOntology, correct CL ID. For GeneOntology, processes like vasculogenesis, angiogenesis, etc. And MeSH terms with their D IDs. Once confirmed, structure the JSON accordingly, ensuring each term is under the correct category with proper formatting.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000115\",\n            \"term\": \"endothelial cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0001570\",\n            \"term\": \"vasculogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0001525\",\n            \"term\": \"angiogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0030198\",\n            \"term\": \"extracellular matrix organization\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0008283\",\n            \"term\": \"cell proliferation\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D000094262\",\n            \"term\": \"Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D005109\",\n            \"term\": \"Extracellular Matrix\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D010957\",\n            \"term\": \"Plasminogen Activators\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D000096362\",\n            \"term\": \"Angiogenesis\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```"

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this CompuCell3D simulation file based on the given ontology annotations. First, I need to recall the structure of a typical CompuCell3D Python script. The user wants imports, a simulation class inheriting from SteppableBasePy, and the required methods: __init__, start, step. Also, the cell types and parameters should align with the provided ontology terms.\n\nLooking at the CellOntology, there's an endothelial cell (CL:0000115). So I'll define that as a cell type. For GeneOntology, terms like vasculogenesis, angiogenesis, extracellular matrix organization, and cell proliferation are mentioned. MeSH terms include VEGF, ECM, Plasminogen Activators, and Angiogenesis. These suggest that the simulation involves processes where endothelial cells migrate, proliferate, and interact with the extracellular matrix, possibly influenced by growth factors like VEGF.\n\nStarting with the imports: I need CompuCellSetup and the necessary modules from PySteppables. Then, the simulation class. In the __init__ method, I should call the parent's __init__ and set up cell types. The start method initializes cells, maybe placing some endothelial cells. The step method can handle behaviors each time step, like proliferation, ECM interaction, and VEGF effects.\n\nFor parameters, since there's cell proliferation (GO:0008283), I'll include a parameter like proliferation_rate. Extracellular matrix organization implies ECM degradation, so maybe a degradation parameter. VEGF would affect cell chemotaxis, so a VEGF gradient parameter. Also, Plasminogen Activators might relate to ECM degradation, so a plasminogen_activator_effect parameter.\n\nIn the start method, I can initialize a grid of endothelial cells. Using the CellField, I can loop through positions and assign cells. For ECM, maybe add a constraint using the FocalPointPlasticity plugin, but perhaps a simpler approach is to use the ExtraFields plugin to model ECM density. But since the user didn't mention specific plugins, I'll keep it basic with cell behaviors.\n\nIn the step method, during each step, cells might divide based on the proliferation rate. Also, check for contact with other cells or ECM, adjust direction based on VEGF. For ECM organization, cells could degrade the matrix when in contact. Plasminogen activators might enhance degradation.\n\nI need to make sure all required methods are present. The simulation class should inherit from SteppableBasePy. Also, register the steppable with CompuCellSetup.\n\nWait, in CompuCell3D, the typical structure includes a main function where you register steppables. But the user wants the code to include the simulation class with the required methods. Let me verify: the code should have the imports, the simulation class with __init__, start, step, and then register it via CompuCellSetup.registerSteppable.\n\nPutting it all together, the code will define the endothelial cell type, set parameters for proliferation, VEGF chemotaxis, ECM degradation. In start, create some cells. In step, handle cell division, chemotaxis towards VEGF, and ECM interaction. The parameters are based on the ontology terms provided.\n</think>\n\n```python\nfrom pybind import CompuCellSetup\nfrom PySteppables import *\n\nclass VascularSimulation(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, simulator, _frequency=10):\n        SteppableBasePy.__init__(self, simulator, _frequency)\n        self.cell_types = {\n            'endothelial': None,\n            'ecm': None\n        }\n        self.params = {\n            'proliferation_rate': 0.01,\n            'ecm_degradation': 0.1,\n            'vegf_gradient': 0.5,\n            'plasminogen_activator_effect': 0.2\n        }\n\n    def start(self):\n        self.cell_types['endothelial'] = self.new_cell_type(\"Endothelial\")\n        self.cell_types['ecm'] = self.new_cell_type(\"ECM\")\n        \n        # Initialize endothelial cells\n        for x, y, z in self.every_pixel():\n            if not self.cellField[x, y, z]:\n                cell = self.new_cell(self.cell_types['endothelial'])\n                self.cellField[x, y, z] = cell\n                cell.targetVolume = 25\n                cell.lambdaVolume = 2.0\n\n    def step(self, mcs):\n        for cell in self.cell_list:\n            if cell.type == self.cell_types['endothelial']:\n                # Proliferation logic\n                if mcs % 100 == 0 and self.random() < self.params['proliferation_rate']:\n                    cell.divide()\n                \n                # ECM interaction\n                if self.contact_with_ecm(cell):\n                    cell.lambdaChemotaxis += self.params['vegf_gradient']\n                    self.degrade_ecm(cell)\n                \n                # Angiogenesis/chemotaxis\n                cell.lambdaChemotaxis = self.params['vegf_gradient']\n\n    def contact_with_ecm(self, cell):\n        return any(neighbor.type == self.cell_types['ecm'] for neighbor in self.get_cell_neighbors(cell))\n    \n    def degrade_ecm(self, cell):\n        for neighbor in self.get_cell_neighbors(cell):\n            if neighbor.type == self.cell_types['ecm']:\n                neighbor.targetVolume -= self.params['ecm_degradation'] * self.params['plasminogen_activator_effect']\n\nCompuCellSetup.register_steppable(VascularSimulation(CompuCellSetup.get_simulator()))\n```"
