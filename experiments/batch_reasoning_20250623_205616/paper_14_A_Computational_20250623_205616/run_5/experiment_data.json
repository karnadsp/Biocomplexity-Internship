        "description": "Vascular development is a complex process regulated by dynamic biological networks that vary in topology and state across different tissues and developmental stages. Signals regulating de novo blood vessel formation (vasculogenesis) and remodeling (angiogenesis) come from a variety of biological pathways linked to endothelial cell (EC) behavior, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and the local generation of chemokines and growth factors. Simulating these interactions at a systems level requires sufficient biological detail about the relevant molecular pathways and associated cellular behaviors, and tractable computational models that offset mathematical and biological complexity. Here, we describe a novel multicellular agent-based model of vasculogenesis using the CompuCell3D (http://www.compucell3d.org/) modeling environment supplemented with semi-automatic knowledgebase creation. The model incorporates vascular endothelial growth factor signals, pro- and anti-angiogenic inflammatory chemokine signals, and the plasminogen activating system of enzymes and proteases linked to ECM interactions, to simulate nascent EC organization, growth and remodeling. The model was shown to recapitulate stereotypical capillary plexus formation and structural emergence of non-coded cellular behaviors, such as a heterologous bridging phenomenon linking endothelial tip cells together during formation of polygonal endothelial cords. Molecular targets in the computational model were mapped to signatures of vascular disruption derived from in vitro chemical profiling using the EPA's ToxCast high-throughput screening (HTS) dataset. Simulating the HTS data with the cell-agent based model of vascular development predicted adverse effects of a reference anti-angiogenic thalidomide analog, 5HPP-33, on in vitro angiogenesis with respect to both concentration-response and morphological consequences.

      "response": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this request step by step. The user wants structured ontology annotations based on the provided information about vascular development. They specified CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH terms, each with exact category names, IDs, and terms.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original description to identify relevant terms. The main focus is on vascular development, endothelial cells (ECs), extracellular matrix (ECM), vasculogenesis, angiogenesis, and related pathways. \n\nFor CellOntology, the key cell type mentioned is endothelial cells. The correct CL ID here is \"CL:0000115\" with the term \"Endothelial Cell\". I should make sure there are no other cell types specified, like tip cells, but the text mentions \"endothelial tip cells\". Checking Cell Ontology, \"Endothelial Tip Cell\" is CL:4030038. So both should be included.\n\nNext, GeneOntology. The processes involved include vasculogenesis (GO:0001570), angiogenesis (GO:0001525), and ECM remodeling. ECM remodeling could correspond to \"Extracellular matrix organization\" (GO:0030198). The plasminogen activating system might relate to \"Proteolysis\" (GO:0006508). Also, there's mention of cell proliferation, but the example uses \"Cell Division\". However, in the original text, \"Cell Proliferation\" is mentioned in the MeSH example. Wait, the user provided an example where \"Cell Division\" is under GeneOntology. But in the text, the model involves cell organization, growth, and remodeling. \"Cell proliferation\" is a GO term (GO:0008283), but the example used \"Cell Division\" (GO:0051301). Need to check which terms are more accurate. The description mentions \"nascent EC organization, growth and remodeling\". Growth here might refer to proliferation. So perhaps \"Cell Proliferation\" (GO:0008283) and \"Extracellular matrix organization\" (GO:0030198), \"Proteolysis\" (GO:0006508), \"Angiogenesis\" (GO:0001525), \"Vasculogenesis\" (GO:0001570). That's five terms. Let me verify each ID:\n\n- Vasculogenesis: GO:0001570\n- Angiogenesis: GO:0001525\n- Extracellular matrix organization: GO:0030198\n- Proteolysis: GO:0006508\n- Cell proliferation: GO:0008283\n\nYes, those are correct.\n\nFor MeSH terms, the relevant areas are vascular development, which maps to \"Neovascularization, Physiologic\" (D054856). Also mentioned are the plasminogen system (\"Plasminogen\" D010957), and the EPA's ToxCast screening which relates to \"High-Throughput Screening\" (D059748). The anti-angiogenic compound 5HPP-33 isn't a MeSH term, but \"Angiogenesis Inhibitors\" (D019379) would apply. Also, \"Computational Biology\" (D056025) is relevant due to the modeling approach. Let me confirm the MeSH IDs:\n\n- Neovascularization, Physiologic: D054856\n- Plasminogen: D010957\n- High-Throughput Screening: D059748\n- Angiogenesis Inhibitors: D019379\n- Computational Biology: D056025\n\nThose IDs check out. \n\nNow, structuring the JSON exactly as per the format. Ensure category names are exact, IDs without spaces, terms correctly spelled. No extra terms. For CellOntology, two entries. GeneOntology five, MeSH five. Let me assemble the JSON accordingly.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000115\",\n            \"term\": \"Endothelial Cell\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:4030038\",\n            \"term\": \"Endothelial Tip Cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0001570\",\n            \"term\": \"Vasculogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0001525\",\n            \"term\": \"Angiogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0030198\",\n            \"term\": \"Extracellular matrix organization\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0006508\",\n            \"term\": \"Proteolysis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0008283\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Proliferation\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D054856\",\n            \"term\": \"Neovascularization, Physiologic\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D010957\",\n            \"term\": \"Plasminogen\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D059748\",\n            \"term\": \"High-Throughput Screening\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D019379\",\n            \"term\": \"Angiogenesis Inhibitors\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D056025\",\n            \"term\": \"Computational Biology\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"

The user wants imports, a simulation class inheriting from SteppableBasePy, and the required methods: __init__, start, step. Also, cell types and parameters based on the given ontologies.\n\nFirst, the necessary imports. CompuCellSetup and steppables are required. So I'll import those. Then, the simulation class. It should inherit from steppables.SteppableBasePy. The __init__ method needs to call the parent's __init__. \n\nThe ontology annotations mention two cell types: Endothelial Tip Cell and Endothelial Cell.

Maybe set their colors as well.\n\nLooking at the GeneOntology terms: Angiogenesis, Vasculogenesis, Proteolysis, Cell Proliferation, ECM organization. These might translate into cell behaviors. For example, cell proliferation can be handled by setting the cell target volume and lambda volume. ECM organization could involve the extracellular matrix, maybe using a secretion field. Proteolysis might involve enzymes degrading the ECM, so perhaps a protease field that cells secrete.\n\nMeSH terms include Angiogenesis Inhibitors and Plasminogen. Maybe add a chemical field for inhibitors that affect cell behavior. Plasminogen could be part of the protease field.\n\nIn the start method, I should initialize the simulation with these cell types and fields. Then, create some initial cells. Maybe place a few tip cells and endothelial cells in the center.\n\nFor the step method, handle cell behaviors each step. For proliferation, check if a cell's volume is above a threshold and then divide. For migration, tip cells might have a bias towards higher ECM or chemical gradients. Also, secretion of proteases and inhibitors can be handled here.\n\nSet up the simulation parameters: dimensions, steps, neighbor order, etc. Define the plugins like Volume, Contact, Chemotaxis. Chemotaxis for tip cells towards ECM gradient. Contact plugin for adhesion between cells.\n\nIn the steppable's start method, initialize the fields and cell types. Create initial cells using self.cell_field. Maybe a cluster of endothelial cells with a tip cell in the middle.\n\nTesting parameters: target volume, lambda volume for proliferation, chemotaxis parameters towards ECM, secretion rates for protease and inhibitor fields.\n\nI need to make sure all the required components are included and the code is valid.
