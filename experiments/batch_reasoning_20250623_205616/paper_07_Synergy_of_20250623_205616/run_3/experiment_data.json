The cell\u2013cell repulsion mechanism is suggested to initiate extracellular lumen formation in large vessels by active repulsion of adjacent cells, and active cell shape changes extend the lumen. We used an agent-based computer model, based on the cellular Potts model, to compare and study both mechanisms separately and combined. An extensive sensitivity analysis shows that each of the mechanisms on its own can produce lumens in a narrow region of parameter space.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants structured ontology annotations based on the provided text about blood vessel development and lumen formation. They specified CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH terms, each with exact formatting.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the original description. The main topics are angiogenesis, lumen formation mechanisms (vacuolation and cell-cell repulsion), and the use of a cellular Potts model. \n\nFor CellOntology, relevant terms might include endothelial cells since they line blood vessels. The term \"Endothelial Cell\" has the ID CL:0000115. Also, \"Blood Vessel Endothelial Cell\" with CL:0002144 is more specific. Maybe \"Epithelial Cell\" isn't directly mentioned, but the text discusses epithelial-like processes in lumen formation. Wait, but the example had \"Epithelial\" under CellOntology. Wait, the original text mentions epithelial? Let me check again. The original text says \"Two alternative lumen formation mechanisms...\", but it's about blood vessels. Endothelial cells line blood vessels, not epithelial. Maybe the user made a mistake in the example. But the example is just an example. The actual text here talks about blood vessels, so Endothelial cells are appropriate. So CellOntology entries should be Endothelial cells.\n\nNext, GeneOntology. The processes involved are angiogenesis (GO:0001525), cell-cell adhesion (since repulsion is part of that, maybe GO:0098742 cell-cell adhesion via plasma-membrane adhesion molecules), and exocytosis (GO:0006887) because vacuoles exocytose. Also, lumen formation in blood vessels might be under GO:0003143 embryonic heart tube/vasculature morphogenesis. Another possibility is vasculogenesis or morphogenesis. Let me check exact terms. Angiogenesis is definitely GO:0001525. For lumen formation, GO:0048536 \"blood vessel lumen development\" exists. Yes, that's more precise. Exocytosis is GO:0006887. Cell shape changes could be GO:0008360 \"regulation of cell shape\". Alternatively, cell morphogenesis involved in differentiation, but maybe more specific. Alternatively, \"cell morphogenesis\" (GO:0000902). Let me verify. The text mentions \"active cell shape changes\", so GO:0008360 might be appropriate. So GO terms: Angiogenesis, blood vessel lumen development, exocytosis, regulation of cell shape.\n\nFor MeSH, the topics are angiogenesis (D000096402), blood vessels (D001808), computer simulation (D003196), and models, biological (D008954). The study uses an agent-based model (computer simulation), so D003196. Also, cellular Potts model might fall under models, biological (D008954). MeSH terms for \"blood vessels\" is D001808. Angiogenesis is D000096402. Lumen formation isn't a MeSH term, but maybe \"Cell Differentiation\" D002454? Wait, the text is about development, so maybe \"Embryonic Development\" D004622. But the exact MeSH terms need to match. Let's check MeSH terms. \"Angiogenesis\" is D000096402. \"Blood Vessels\" is D001808. \"Computer Simulation\" is D003196. \"Models, Biological\" is D008954. So those four seem relevant.\n\nNow, assemble the JSON. Ensure exact category names, IDs without spaces, and terms as per the examples. Check for any typos. Let me confirm each ID and term:\n\nCellOntology:\n- CL:0000115 Endothelial Cell\n- CL:0002144 Blood Vessel Endothelial Cell\n\nGeneOntology:\n- GO:0001525 Angiogenesis\n- GO:0048536 Blood Vessel Lumen Development\n- GO:0006887 Exocytosis\n- GO:0008360 Regulation of Cell Shape\n\nMeSH:\n- D000096402 Angiogenesis\n- D001808 Blood Vessels\n- D003196 Computer Simulation\n- D008954 Models, Biological\n\nYes, these match. Ensure no extra spaces in terms. Capitalization as per the ontologies. For example, \"Blood Vessel Endothelial Cell\" is correct. \"Regulation of Cell Shape\" is the correct term for GO:0008360. MeSH terms use their exact names, like \"Computer Simulation\" and \"Models, Biological\" with the comma. All IDs are correctly formatted without spaces.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000115\",\n            \"term\": \"Endothelial Cell\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0002144\",\n            \"term\": \"Blood Vessel Endothelial Cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0001525\",\n            \"term\": \"Angiogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0048536\",\n            \"term\": \"Blood Vessel Lumen Development\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0006887\",\n            \"term\": \"Exocytosis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0008360\",\n            \"term\": \"Regulation of Cell Shape\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D000096402\",\n            \"term\": \"Angiogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D001808\",\n            \"term\": \"Blood Vessels\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D003196\",\n            \"term\": \"Computer Simulation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D008954\",\n            \"term\": \"Models, Biological\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"

The user wants a Python script that includes specific elements: necessary imports, a simulation class inheriting from SteppableBasePy, and methods like __init__, start, and step. Also, the cell types and parameters should be based on the provided ontologies.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the structure of a typical CompuCell3D simulation script. The main components are the imports from CompuCellSetup and the steppables module. Then, defining a simulation class that extends SteppableBasePy. The __init__ method usually calls the parent's init. The start method is where initialization happens, like setting up cell types and fields. The step method runs at each simulation step.\n\nLooking at the ontology annotations, the cell types are Blood Vessel Endothelial Cell and Endothelial Cell. So I'll need to define these cell types in the start method. The GeneOntology terms mention processes like regulation of cell shape, exocytosis, blood vessel lumen development, and angiogenesis. MeSH terms include models, blood vessels, computer simulation, and angiogenesis.\n\nIn the simulation parameters, I should include things related to cell motility, adhesion, and possibly secretion to model exocytosis. Since angiogenesis involves blood vessel formation, maybe cell growth and chemotaxis towards a growth factor could be relevant. Lumen development might involve constraints on cell volume or pressure.\n\nIn the start method, I should initialize the cell types with their respective properties. Maybe set different adhesion coefficients for the two cell types. For the step method, perhaps adjust target volumes based on conditions to simulate cell shape changes. Also, introducing a chemical field for chemotaxis could model angiogenesis.\n\nI need to make sure the code includes all required parts. The imports are straightforward. The simulation class must inherit correctly. In start(), define cell types, set up the chemical field, and configure plugins like Volume, Contact, and Chemotaxis. In step(), maybe check if cells are of a certain type and adjust their target volume or apply chemotaxis.\n\nWait, should I include a chemical field for chemotaxis? The exocytosis and angiogenesis might require a growth factor secreted by cells. So adding a secretion data to the endothelial cells could simulate exocytosis. Also, chemotaxis towards that chemical would direct cell movement during angiogenesis.\n\nLet me structure this. In the start method, create the cell types, assign their properties. Set up the chemical field, perhaps 'VEGF' as it's involved in angiogenesis. Use the Secretion plugin to have cells secrete VEGF, and Chemotaxis to make them move towards higher concentrations. Also, set adhesion parameters to regulate cell shape through contact energy.\n\nIn the step method, maybe periodically increase the target volume of certain cells to simulate growth, or adjust adhesion as the simulation progresses. But since the user asked for a basic setup, maybe keep step() simple, just calling the parent step.\n\nI need to make sure all the plugins are properly registered and configured. The XML part is handled by CompuCellSetup, but in the Python script, using the registered steppables and plugins correctly.\n\nPutting it all together: imports, simulation class with init, start (setting up cell types, fields, plugins), and step. The parameters should reflect the ontology terms, like cell adhesion for shape regulation, secretion and chemotaxis for angiogenesis and exocytosis.\n\nCheck if all required elements are included.
