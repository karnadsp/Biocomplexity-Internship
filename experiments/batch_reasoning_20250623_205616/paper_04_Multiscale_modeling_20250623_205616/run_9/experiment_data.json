Upon encountering antigen presenting cells, T-cell receptor activation promotes the differentiation of na\u00efve CD8 T-cells into strongly proliferating activated and effector stages. We propose a 2D-multiscale computational model to study the maturation of CD8 T-cells in a lymph node controlled by their molecular profile. A novel molecular pathway is presented and converted into an ordinary differential equation model, coupled with a cellular Potts model to describe cell-cell interactions. Key molecular players such as activated IL2 receptor and Tbet levels control the differentiation from na\u00efve into activated and effector stages, respectively, while caspases and Fas-Fas ligand interactions control cell apoptosis. Coupling this molecular model to the cellular scale successfully reproduces qualitatively the evolution of total CD8 T-cell counts observed in mice lymph node, between Day 3 and 5.5 post-infection. Furthermore, this model allows us to make testable predictions of the evolution of the different CD8 T-cell stages."

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this request step by step. The user wants structured ontology annotations based on the provided biological description. They specified Cell Ontology, Gene Ontology (GO), and MeSH terms.\n\nFirst, I'll look for cell types mentioned. The main cell here is CD8 T-cells. Checking Cell Ontology, the correct term for CD8-positive, alpha-beta T cell is CL:0000625. So that goes under CellOntology.\n\nNext, Gene Ontology. The description mentions T-cell receptor activation, differentiation, apoptosis. For GO terms:\n- T-cell receptor signaling pathway is GO:0050852.\n- T-cell differentiation is GO:0030217.\n- Apoptotic process is GO:0006915.\nThese are all relevant processes here.\n\nFor MeSH terms, the study involves computational models. Terms like \"Models, Biological\" (D008957) and \"Computer Simulation\" (D003196) fit. Also, \"Lymph Nodes\" (D008198) as the location, and \"CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes\" (D054888) as the cell type in MeSH.\n\nI need to ensure all IDs are correctly formatted without spaces. Term names should match exactly. Let me double-check each ontology database to confirm the IDs and terms. Once verified, structure them into the JSON as per the example, making sure categories are named exactly as specified.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000625\",\n            \"term\": \"CD8-positive, alpha-beta T cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0050852\",\n            \"term\": \"T cell receptor signaling pathway\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0030217\",\n            \"term\": \"T cell differentiation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0006915\",\n            \"term\": \"Apoptotic process\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D008957\",\n            \"term\": \"Models, Biological\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D003196\",\n            \"term\": \"Computer Simulation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D008198\",\n            \"term\": \"Lymph Nodes\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D054888\",\n            \"term\": \"CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a CompuCell3D simulation Python file based on the given ontology annotations. Let's break down the requirements.\n\nFirst, the user wants imports for CompuCellSetup and steppables. I remember that in CompuCell3D, you typically import those to set up the simulation. So I'll start with:\n\nfrom pybindlib import cc3d\nimport CompuCellSetup\nfrom PySteppables import SteppableBasePy\n\nNext, the simulation class must inherit from SteppableBasePy. The class should have __init__, start, and step methods. The __init__ method usually calls the parent's __init__. The start method is for initial setup, and step runs each simulation step.\n\nLooking at the ontology annotations, the cell type is CD8-positive T cells. So I need to define that cell type in the start method using self.cellType. Also, the Gene Ontology terms include T cell differentiation, receptor signaling, and apoptosis. I should model some differentiation, maybe a signaling pathway affecting behavior, and apoptosis.\n\nIn the start method, I'll set up the cell type and maybe some initial cells. Using self.cellField to access the grid and create a cell. For apoptosis, perhaps set a target volume and then in the step method check for lysed cells to remove them.\n\nThe MeSH terms mention lymph nodes and models. Maybe set the simulation dimensions to represent a lymph node-like environment. The XML line in the code sets the dim parameters, so I'll include that in the main function.\n\nParameters based on ontology: For differentiation, maybe track a chemical like IL-2 using a field. In the step method, cells could differentiate based on concentration. For signaling, cells might move towards a chemokine gradient, but that's more complex. Since the example is basic, maybe just include a secretion and chemotaxis setup in the XML.\n\nApoptosis can be handled by checking if a cell's volume drops below a threshold, then killing it. Using cell.targetVolume and cell.lambdaVolume in the start method. In step, check if volume is too low and call cell.lysis = True.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- Imports are correct.\n- Simulation class with required methods.\n- In start, define cell type, create a cell, set volume params.\n- In step, check for apoptosis, maybe some differentiation based on a chemical.\n- XML setup with Dim, steps, etc.\n\nWait, the user also mentioned returning only the code without explanations. So the code should include the XML part in the main function. Also, the main function runs the simulation with CompuCellSetup.\n\nLet me check for any missing parts. The cell types are defined, basic parameters like target volume and lambda for volume constraint. Apoptosis is handled by lysing cells when volume is too low. Differentiation might need more, but given the basic setup, perhaps just a placeholder.\n\nI think that's the structure. Now code:\n\nMake sure the main block has the XML setup with the right dimensions and plugins. Include Volume, Contact, Chemotaxis (for T cell signaling path), and maybe Secretion. Add the steppable to the simulation.\n\nTesting if all elements are present: yes. The code should run as a basic simulation of CD8 T cells with apoptosis, volume regulation, and some chemical fields for differentiation and signaling.\n</think>\n\n```python\nfrom pybindlib import cc3d\nimport CompuCellSetup\nfrom PySteppables import SteppableBasePy\n\nclass TCellSimulation(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, simulator, frequency=1):\n        super().__init__(simulator, frequency)\n        self.cell_type = None\n        self.chemotaxis_field = None\n\n    def start(self):\n        self.cell_type = self.new_cell_type(\"CD8_T_CELL\")\n        \n        # Set up initial cell\n        cell = self.potts.createCell()\n        cell.type = self.cell_type\n        self.cellField[10:90, 10:90, 0] = cell\n        \n        # Configure volume parameters\n        self.setVolumeParams(cell, 25, 50, 2, 10)\n        \n        # Set up apoptosis parameters\n        self.set_apoptosis_params(cell, 15)\n        \n        # Initialize chemical field for signaling\n        self.chemotaxis_field = self.create_field(\"Chemokine\")\n        self.add_chemotaxis(cell, \"Chemokine\", 200)\n\n    def step(self, mcs):\n        for cell in self.cell_list:\n            if cell.type == self.cell_type:\n                # Apoptosis check\n                if cell.volume < 15:\n                    cell.lysis = True\n                \n                # Simulate differentiation through chemical exposure\n                if mcs % 100 == 0 and self.chemotaxis_field[cell.xCOM, cell.yCOM, 0] > 50:\n                    self.setVolumeParams(cell, cell.targetVolume+5, cell.targetVolume+10, 2, 10)\n\n    def set_apoptosis_params(self, cell, death_volume):\n        cell.targetVolume = death_volume\n        cell.lambdaVolume = 2\n\n    def setVolumeParams(self, cell, target, max, lambda_, temp):\n        cell.targetVolume = target\n        cell.maxVolume = max\n        cell.lambdaVolume = lambda_\n        cell.temperature = temp\n\n# Main simulation configuration\ndef configure_simulation():\n    cc3d.runGUI()\n    sim, simthread = CompuCellSetup.getCoreSimulationObjects()\n    \n    # Add necessary plugins\n    pt = cc3d.PluginTracker()\n    pt.add(\"VolumeTracker\")\n    pt.add(\"Chemotaxis\")\n    pt.add(\"ContactLocalFlex\")\n    pt.add(\"Secretion\")\n    \n    # Configure XML elements\n    CompuCellSetup.setSimulationXMLDescriptor(\"<Simulation><version>4.0.0</version></Simulation>\")\n    CompuCellSetup.setSimulationXMLDescription(\"<Potts><Dimensions x=100 y=100 z=1/><Steps>1000</Steps></Potts>\")\n    \n    # Register steppable\n    CompuCellSetup.register_steppable(steppable=TCellSimulation(sim))\n    \n    return CompuCellSetup.init(sim, simthread)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    configure_simulation()\n```"
