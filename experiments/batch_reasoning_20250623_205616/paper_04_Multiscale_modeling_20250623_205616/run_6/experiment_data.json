      "response": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this. The user wants a JSON object with ontology annotations for CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH based on the provided description.\n\nFirst, looking at the original description. It's about CD8 T-cells, their activation, differentiation into effector stages, molecular pathways involving IL2 receptor, Tbet, caspases, Fas-Fas ligand interactions, apoptosis, and a computational model using ODE and cellular Potts model.\n\nFor CellOntology, the main cell type mentioned is CD8 T-cells. The Cell Ontology ID for CD8-positive, alpha-beta T cell is CL:0000625. Also, the differentiation stages include naive, activated, and effector. Checking Cell Ontology, naive CD8 T-cell is CL:0000900, activated is CL:0000913, and effector CD8 T-cell is CL:0000917. So these should be included.\n\nGeneOntology terms: The processes mentioned are T-cell receptor activation (GO:0050860), cell differentiation (GO:0030217), apoptosis (GO:0006915), cell proliferation (GO:0008283), and interleukin-2 receptor activity (GO:0004916). Also, Fas-Fas ligand interaction might relate to apoptotic signaling (GO:0008625). But need to check exact terms. Fas-FasL interaction is part of the extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway, so GO:0008625 is correct.\n\nMeSH terms: CD8-positive T-lymphocytes (D053686), Cell Differentiation (D002454), Apoptosis (D017209), Cell Proliferation (D049109), Lymph Nodes (D008198). The model is in the context of a lymph node, so D008198 is relevant. Also, computational models here might relate to \"Models, Biological\" (D008954) and \"Molecular Models\" (D015334). But the user might not expect the model terms unless specified. The original text mentions a computational model, so including D008954 and D015334 makes sense.\n\nNeed to ensure the terms are correctly spelled and IDs are exact without spaces. Also, category names must be exact: CellOntology, GeneOntology, MeSH.\n\nLet me verify each ID:\n\n- CL:0000625: CD8-positive, alpha-beta T cell\n- CL:0000900: naive CD8-positive, alpha-beta T cell\n- CL:0000913: activated CD8-positive, alpha-beta T cell\n- CL:0000917: effector CD8-positive, alpha-beta T cell\n\nGO:0050860: T cell receptor signaling pathway\nWait, the original text says \"T-cell receptor activation promotes differentiation\". The GO term for T-cell receptor activation might be GO:0050860 (positive regulation of T cell activation), but the exact term for T-cell receptor signaling pathway is GO:0050852. Wait, checking GO:0050860 is \"positive regulation of B cell receptor signaling pathway\", which doesn't fit. Let me check again.\n\nLooking up \"T-cell receptor activation\" in GO: The term might be \"T cell receptor signaling pathway\" (GO:0050852). Alternatively, \"T cell activation\" is GO:0042110. But the description here is about T-cell receptor activation leading to differentiation. So GO:0042110 (T cell activation) would be more appropriate. Let me confirm:\n\nGO:0042110: T cell activation. That's correct. So I'll use that. However, the user might expect \"T-cell receptor activation\" as a term. If the exact term exists, but I need to check.\n\nAlternatively, if the exact term isn't present, use the closest. Let me check. GO:0050852 is \"T cell receptor signaling pathway\", which is part of activation. So perhaps that's better. But the original description says \"T-cell receptor activation promotes differentiation\". So the process here is activation via TCR. So GO:0050852 is the signaling pathway, which is part of activation. Alternatively, GO:0042110 is the activation process. Let me confirm:\n\nGO:0042110: T cell activation. Definition: \"The change in morphology and behavior of a mature or immature T cell resulting from exposure to a mitogen, cytokine, chemokine, cellular ligand, or soluble antigen, leading to the initiation or perpetuation of an immune response.\" This seems to fit. So including GO:0042110.\n\nIL2 receptor activity: GO:0004916 (interleukin-2 receptor activity). Correct.\n\nApoptosis: GO:0006915 (apoptotic process). Correct.\n\nCell differentiation: GO:0030217 (T cell differentiation). Wait, the term mentioned is differentiation of CD8 T-cells into activated and effector stages. The general term is cell differentiation (GO:0030154), but more specific is T cell differentiation (GO:0030217). Yes, that's better.\n\nCell proliferation: GO:0008283 (cell population proliferation). Alternatively, \"cell proliferation\" is GO:0042127 (regulation of cell proliferation). Wait, the original text mentions \"strongly proliferating activated and effector stages\". So the process is cell proliferation. The correct GO term for cell proliferation is GO:0008283 (cell population proliferation). Yes.\n\nFas-Fas ligand interactions control apoptosis. The process here is extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway via death domain receptors, which is GO:0008625. Correct.\n\nSo GeneOntology entries would be:\n- T cell activation (GO:0042110)\n- T cell differentiation (GO:0030217)\n- apoptotic process (GO:0006915)\n- cell population proliferation (GO:0008283)\n- interleukin-2 receptor activity (GO:0004916)\n- extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway (GO:0008625)\n\nMeSH terms:\n- CD8-positive T-lymphocytes (D053686)\n- Cell Differentiation (D002454)\n- Apoptosis (D017209)\n- Cell Proliferation (D049109)\n- Lymph Nodes (D008198)\n- Models, Biological (D008954)\n- Molecular Models (D015334)\n\nSo compiling all these into the JSON structure as specified. Make sure no extra spaces in IDs and terms are exact. Check for typos.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000625\",\n            \"term\": \"CD8-positive, alpha-beta T cell\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000900\",\n            \"term\": \"naive CD8-positive, alpha-beta T cell\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000913\",\n            \"term\": \"activated CD8-positive, alpha-beta T cell\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000917\",\n            \"term\": \"effector CD8-positive, alpha-beta T cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0042110\",\n            \"term\": \"T cell activation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0030217\",\n            \"term\": \"T cell differentiation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0006915\",\n            \"term\": \"apoptotic process\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0008283\",\n            \"term\": \"cell population proliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0004916\",\n            \"term\": \"interleukin-2 receptor activity\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0008625\",\n            \"term\": \"extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D053686\",\n            \"term\": \"CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002454\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Differentiation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D017209\",\n            \"term\": \"Apoptosis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D049109\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Proliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D008198\",\n            \"term\": \"Lymph Nodes\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D008954\",\n            \"term\": \"Models, Biological\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D015334\",\n            \"term\": \"Molecular Models\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"

Basic cell types and parameters based on the ontology annotations",
      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user wants a CompuCell3D simulation file based on the given ontology annotations. First, I need to parse the ontologies provided.\n\nLooking at the Cell Ontology, there are different CD8+ T cell types: effector, naive, activated. So the simulation should include these cell types. The Gene Ontology terms mention T cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and activation. MeSH terms include cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, lymph nodes, and CD8+ T cells. \n\nSo the simulation needs to model T cells that can differentiate, proliferate, undergo apoptosis, and interact. Since it's a basic setup, I'll start by defining the cell types. The CompuCell3D setup usually requires defining cell types in the XML, but here we need to do it in Python. Wait, in CC3D Python scripts, you can define cell types using the CellTypePlugin.\n\nThe simulation class should inherit from SteppableBasePy. The __init__ method must call the parent's __init__. In the start method, I can initialize cells, maybe place some randomly. The step method can handle behaviors each time step, like checking for apoptosis or differentiation.\n\nFor the apoptosis part, the extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway (GO:0008625) implies that cells might have a death condition based on some signal. Maybe a probability to apoptosis when a certain condition is met, like age or contact. But since it's basic, perhaps a random chance each step.\n\nT cell differentiation (GO:0030217) and activation (GO:0042110) suggest that naive cells can become activated, and activated become effector. Maybe after a certain number of steps or upon receiving a signal. For simplicity, maybe after a certain time, a naive cell turns into activated, then effector.\n\nCell proliferation (GO:0008283) means cells can divide. In CC3D, this is handled via the VolumePlugin, setting target volumes and lambda parameters. So each cell type should have growth parameters.\n\nInterleukin-2 receptor activity (GO:0004916) could be modeled by having activated cells secrete a substance that others respond to, but maybe that's too complex for a basic script. Maybe skip that for now.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n- Import necessary modules: CompuCellSetup, steppables, cc3d, etc.\n- Define a simulation class with __init__, start, step.\n- In start, initialize cell types and maybe some cells.\n- In step, handle differentiation, apoptosis, proliferation.\n- Use the apoptosis plugin to mark cells for death.\n- Set up volume constraints and contact energy in the XML via the player.\n\nWait, but the user wants the Python code only. So the XML configuration (like plugins) is usually in another file, but since they asked for the Python code, maybe include the XML configuration via the cc3d.core.XMLUtils or within the script using the CompuCellSetup.register_steppable.\n\nWait, no. The user wants the Python simulation file, which in CC3D is typically a separate script that defines steppables. The main simulation setup (like plugins) is often in a separate XML file. But the user hasn't provided that, so maybe the Python code has to include all necessary setup via the XML elements within the script.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code uses cc3d.CompuCellSetup.run() and includes the XML configuration in the script. Wait, but in standard CC3D, the main simulation configuration (like plugins) is in XML. However, the user wants the Python code, which is likely the steppable code. So I need to create a Python file that defines the steppables, cell types, and their behaviors.\n\nWait, CompuCell3D's Python scripts usually work alongside an XML configuration file. But the user wants the Python code that includes everything. Maybe the code uses the cc3d.CompuCellSetup.setup() to configure the simulation within Python. Let me check.\n\nIn some examples, you can configure the simulation via Python without XML. For example:\n\nimport cc3d.CompuCellSetup as CompuCellSetup\nfrom cc3d.core.PyCoreSpecs import *\n\nBut perhaps the user expects a standard steppable file that would be included in a simulation, which relies on an XML for plugins. Since the user didn't specify, but wants the code to include the required imports and setup.\n\nHmm. The problem says \"Generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file.\" So perhaps a full Python script that can be run directly, which sets up the simulation using Python-only configuration, without needing an XML.\n\nIn that case, I need to use the core specs to define the simulation parameters. So, the code would import necessary modules, define cell types, set up plugins (like Volume, Contact, Apoptosis), and define the steppable.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nFirst, import CompuCellSetup and necessary modules. Then define the specs for the simulation. Then create the simulation class.\n\nWait, but the user specified that the code must include required imports, a proper simulation class that inherits from steppables.SteppableBasePy, required methods (__init__, start, step), and basic cell types based on the ontology.\n\nSo maybe the code uses the traditional approach where the XML is separate, but the Python script defines the steppables. Therefore, the code would have:\n\nImports: CompuCellSetup, steppables, and perhaps cc3d.\n\nThen, the simulation class inherits from SteppableBasePy. In __init__, call the parent __init__, and maybe set up cell types. In the start method, initialize cells. In step, handle the dynamics.\n\nBut to define cell types, maybe in the start method using the cell field.\n\nWait, here's an example structure:\n\nfrom cc3d import CompuCellSetup\nfrom cc3d.core.PySteppables import *\n\nclass SimulationSteppable(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, frequency=1):\n        super().__init__(frequency)\n    \n    def start(self):\n        # Define cell types\n        self.cell_type_naive = self.add_cell_type(\"NaiveCD8T\")\n        self.cell_type_activated = self.add_cell_type(\"ActivatedCD8T\")\n        self.cell_type_effector = self.add_cell_type(\"EffectorCD8T\")\n        \n        # Initialize cells\n        for _ in range(100):\n            cell = self.new_cell(self.cell_type_naive)\n            self.cell_field[random.randint(0,100), random.randint(0,100), 0] = cell\n        \n        # Set volume parameters\n        self.set_volume_parameters(self.cell_type_naive, target_volume=25, lambda_volume=2.0)\n        self.set_volume_parameters(self.cell_type_activated, target_volume=25, lambda_volume=2.0)\n        self.set_volume_parameters(self.cell_type_effector, target_volume=25, lambda_volume=2.0)\n        \n    def step(self, mcs):\n        for cell in self.cell_list:\n            # Apoptosis process\n            if cell.type == self.cell_type_naive or cell.type == self.cell_type_activated or cell.type == self.cell_type_effector:\n                if random.random() < 0.001:  # 0.1% chance per step\n                    cell.targetVolume = 0\n                    cell.lambdaVolume = 100\n            # Differentiation and activation\n            if cell.type == self.cell_type_naive and mcs > 10:\n                cell.type = self.cell_type_activated\n            elif cell.type == self.cell_type_activated and mcs > 20:\n                cell.type = self.cell_type_effector\n            # Proliferation: handled via volume, so when cell grows beyond threshold, it divides\n            # CompuCell handles this automatically based on volume parameters\n\n        # Ensure apoptosis is processed\n        self.apoptosis_plugin.process_cells()\n\nThen, register the steppable:\n\nCompuCellSetup.register_steppable(steppable=SimulationSteppable(frequency=1))\n\nBut wait, also need to set up the plugins. For apoptosis, Volume, Contact, etc. But in the Python-only setup, how to do that?\n\nAh, right. If using the new core specs (from cc3d.core.PyCoreSpecs), you can define all parameters in Python. So perhaps the code should include that.\n\nBut the user's answer needs to be the Python code that is valid. Let me structure it properly.\n\nThe full code would:\n\n1. Import necessary modules (CompuCellSetup, PyCoreSpecs, etc.)\n\n2. Define cell types, contact energies, volume parameters.\n\n3. Define the steppable class with start and step methods.\n\nBut I think the user expects the traditional approach where the Python code is a steppable file, but the plugins are set up via XML. However, since they want the code to include everything, maybe we need to use the core specs.\n\nHere's an attempt:\n\nimport cc3d.CompuCellSetup as CompuCellSetup\nfrom cc3d.core.PyCoreSpecs import *\nfrom cc3d.core.PySteppables import *\n\n# Set up core specs\nspecs = CoreSpecs()\nspecs.register_plugin(type='Volume', initial_parameters={})\nspecs"

The model is in the context of a lymph node, so D008198 is relevant. Also, computational models here might relate to \"Models, Biological\" (D008954) and \"Molecular Models\" (D015334). But the user might not expect the model terms unless specified. The original text mentions a computational model, so including D008954 and D015334 makes sense.\n\nNeed to ensure the terms are correctly spelled and IDs are exact without spaces. Also, category names must be exact: CellOntology, GeneOntology, MeSH.\n\nLet me verify each ID:\n\n- CL:0000625: CD8-positive, alpha-beta T cell\n- CL:0000900: naive CD8-positive, alpha-beta T cell\n- CL:0000913: activated CD8-positive, alpha-beta T cell\n- CL:0000917: effector CD8-positive, alpha-beta T cell\n\nGO:0050860: T cell receptor signaling pathway\nWait, the original text says \"T-cell receptor activation promotes differentiation\". The GO term for T-cell receptor activation might be GO:0050860 (positive regulation of T cell activation), but the exact term for T-cell receptor signaling pathway is GO:0050852. Wait, checking GO:0050860 is \"positive regulation of B cell receptor signaling pathway\", which doesn't fit. Let me check again.\n\nLooking up \"T-cell receptor activation\" in GO: The term might be \"T cell receptor signaling pathway\" (GO:0050852). Alternatively, \"T cell activation\" is GO:0042110. But the description here is about T-cell receptor activation leading to differentiation. So GO:0042110 (T cell activation) would be more appropriate. Let me confirm:\n\nGO:0042110: T cell activation. That's correct. So I'll use that. However, the user might expect \"T-cell receptor activation\" as a term. If the exact term exists, but I need to check.\n\nAlternatively, if the exact term isn't present, use the closest. Let me check. GO:0050852 is \"T cell receptor signaling pathway\", which is part of activation. So perhaps that's better. But the original description says \"T-cell receptor activation promotes differentiation\". So the process here is activation via TCR. So GO:0050852 is the signaling pathway, which is part of activation. Alternatively, GO:0042110 is the activation process. Let me confirm:\n\nGO:0042110: T cell activation. Definition: \"The change in morphology and behavior of a mature or immature T cell resulting from exposure to a mitogen, cytokine, chemokine, cellular ligand, or soluble antigen, leading to the initiation or perpetuation of an immune response.\" This seems to fit. So including GO:0042110.\n\nIL2 receptor activity: GO:0004916 (interleukin-2 receptor activity). Correct.\n\nApoptosis: GO:0006915 (apoptotic process). Correct.\n\nCell differentiation: GO:0030217 (T cell differentiation). Wait, the term mentioned is differentiation of CD8 T-cells into activated and effector stages. The general term is cell differentiation (GO:0030154), but more specific is T cell differentiation (GO:0030217). Yes, that's better.\n\nCell proliferation: GO:0008283 (cell population proliferation). Alternatively, \"cell proliferation\" is GO:0042127 (regulation of cell proliferation). Wait, the original text mentions \"strongly proliferating activated and effector stages\". So the process is cell proliferation. The correct GO term for cell proliferation is GO:0008283 (cell population proliferation). Yes.\n\nFas-Fas ligand interactions control apoptosis. The process here is extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway via death domain receptors, which is GO:0008625. Correct.\n\nSo GeneOntology entries would be:\n- T cell activation (GO:0042110)\n- T cell differentiation (GO:0030217)\n- apoptotic process (GO:0006915)\n- cell population proliferation (GO:0008283)\n- interleukin-2 receptor activity (GO:0004916)\n- extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway (GO:0008625)\n\nMeSH terms:\n- CD8-positive T-lymphocytes (D053686)\n- Cell Differentiation (D002454)\n- Apoptosis (D017209)\n- Cell Proliferation (D049109)\n- Lymph Nodes (D008198)\n- Models, Biological (D008954)\n- Molecular Models (D015334)\n\nSo compiling all these into the JSON structure as specified. Make sure no extra spaces in IDs and terms are exact. Check for typos.\n</think>",

      "python_code": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user wants a CompuCell3D simulation file based on the given ontology annotations. First, I need to parse the ontologies provided.\n\nLooking at the Cell Ontology, there are different CD8+ T cell types: effector, naive, activated. So the simulation should include these cell types. The Gene Ontology terms mention T cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and activation. MeSH terms include cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, lymph nodes, and CD8+ T cells. \n\nSo the simulation needs to model T cells that can differentiate, proliferate, undergo apoptosis, and interact. Since it's a basic setup, I'll start by defining the cell types. The CompuCell3D setup usually requires defining cell types in the XML, but here we need to do it in Python. Wait, in CC3D Python scripts, you can define cell types using the CellTypePlugin.\n\nThe simulation class should inherit from SteppableBasePy. The __init__ method must call the parent's __init__. In the start method, I can initialize cells, maybe place some randomly. The step method can handle behaviors each time step, like checking for apoptosis or differentiation.\n\nFor the apoptosis part, the extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway (GO:0008625) implies that cells might have a death condition based on some signal. Maybe a probability to apoptosis when a certain condition is met, like age or contact. But since it's basic, perhaps a random chance each step.\n\nT cell differentiation (GO:0030217) and activation (GO:0042110) suggest that naive cells can become activated, and activated become effector. Maybe after a certain number of steps or upon receiving a signal. For simplicity, maybe after a certain time, a naive cell turns into activated, then effector.\n\nCell proliferation (GO:0008283) means cells can divide. In CC3D, this is handled via the VolumePlugin, setting target volumes and lambda parameters. So each cell type should have growth parameters.\n\nInterleukin-2 receptor activity (GO:0004916) could be modeled by having activated cells secrete a substance that others respond to, but maybe that's too complex for a basic script. Maybe skip that for now.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n- Import necessary modules: CompuCellSetup, steppables, cc3d, etc.\n- Define a simulation class with __init__, start, step.\n- In start, initialize cell types and maybe some cells.\n- In step, handle differentiation, apoptosis, proliferation.\n- Use the apoptosis plugin to mark cells for death.\n- Set up volume constraints and contact energy in the XML via the player.\n\nWait, but the user wants the Python code only. So the XML configuration (like plugins) is usually in another file, but since they asked for the Python code, maybe include the XML configuration via the cc3d.core.XMLUtils or within the script using the CompuCellSetup.register_steppable.\n\nWait, no. The user wants the Python simulation file, which in CC3D is typically a separate script that defines steppables. The main simulation setup (like plugins) is often in a separate XML file. But the user hasn't provided that, so maybe the Python code has to include all necessary setup via the XML elements within the script.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code uses cc3d.CompuCellSetup.run() and includes the XML configuration in the script. Wait, but in standard CC3D, the main simulation configuration (like plugins) is in XML. However, the user wants the Python code, which is likely the steppable code. So I need to create a Python file that defines the steppables, cell types, and their behaviors.\n\nWait, CompuCell3D's Python scripts usually work alongside an XML configuration file. But the user wants the Python code that includes everything. Maybe the code uses the cc3d.CompuCellSetup.setup() to configure the simulation within Python. Let me check.\n\nIn some examples, you can configure the simulation via Python without XML. For example:\n\nimport cc3d.CompuCellSetup as CompuCellSetup\nfrom cc3d.core.PyCoreSpecs import *\n\nBut perhaps the user expects a standard steppable file that would be included in a simulation, which relies on an XML for plugins. Since the user didn't specify, but wants the code to include the required imports and setup.\n\nHmm. The problem says \"Generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file.\" So perhaps a full Python script that can be run directly, which sets up the simulation using Python-only configuration, without needing an XML.\n\nIn that case, I need to use the core specs to define the simulation parameters. So, the code would import necessary modules, define cell types, set up plugins (like Volume, Contact, Apoptosis), and define the steppable.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nFirst, import CompuCellSetup and necessary modules. Then define the specs for the simulation. Then create the simulation class.\n\nWait, but the user specified that the code must include required imports, a proper simulation class that inherits from steppables.SteppableBasePy, required methods (__init__, start, step), and basic cell types based on the ontology.\n\nSo maybe the code uses the traditional approach where the XML is separate, but the Python script defines the steppables. Therefore, the code would have:\n\nImports: CompuCellSetup, steppables, and perhaps cc3d.\n\nThen, the simulation class inherits from SteppableBasePy. In __init__, call the parent __init__, and maybe set up cell types. In the start method, initialize cells. In step, handle the dynamics.\n\nBut to define cell types, maybe in the start method using the cell field.\n\nWait, here's an example structure:\n\nfrom cc3d import CompuCellSetup\nfrom cc3d.core.PySteppables import *\n\nclass SimulationSteppable(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, frequency=1):\n        super().__init__(frequency)\n    \n    def start(self):\n        # Define cell types\n        self.cell_type_naive = self.add_cell_type(\"NaiveCD8T\")\n        self.cell_type_activated = self.add_cell_type(\"ActivatedCD8T\")\n        self.cell_type_effector = self.add_cell_type(\"EffectorCD8T\")\n        \n        # Initialize cells\n        for _ in range(100):\n            cell = self.new_cell(self.cell_type_naive)\n            self.cell_field[random.randint(0,100), random.randint(0,100), 0] = cell\n        \n        # Set volume parameters\n        self.set_volume_parameters(self.cell_type_naive, target_volume=25, lambda_volume=2.0)\n        self.set_volume_parameters(self.cell_type_activated, target_volume=25, lambda_volume=2.0)\n        self.set_volume_parameters(self.cell_type_effector, target_volume=25, lambda_volume=2.0)\n        \n    def step(self, mcs):\n        for cell in self.cell_list:\n            # Apoptosis process\n            if cell.type == self.cell_type_naive or cell.type == self.cell_type_activated or cell.type == self.cell_type_effector:\n                if random.random() < 0.001:  # 0.1% chance per step\n                    cell.targetVolume = 0\n                    cell.lambdaVolume = 100\n            # Differentiation and activation\n            if cell.type == self.cell_type_naive and mcs > 10:\n                cell.type = self.cell_type_activated\n            elif cell.type == self.cell_type_activated and mcs > 20:\n                cell.type = self.cell_type_effector\n            # Proliferation: handled via volume, so when cell grows beyond threshold, it divides\n            # CompuCell handles this automatically based on volume parameters\n\n        # Ensure apoptosis is processed\n        self.apoptosis_plugin.process_cells()\n\nThen, register the steppable:\n\nCompuCellSetup.register_steppable(steppable=SimulationSteppable(frequency=1))\n\nBut wait, also need to set up the plugins. For apoptosis, Volume, Contact, etc. But in the Python-only setup, how to do that?\n\nAh, right. If using the new core specs (from cc3d.core.PyCoreSpecs), you can define all parameters in Python. So perhaps the code should include that.\n\nBut the user's answer needs to be the Python code that is valid. Let me structure it properly.\n\nThe full code would:\n\n1. Import necessary modules (CompuCellSetup, PyCoreSpecs, etc.)\n\n2. Define cell types, contact energies, volume parameters.\n\n3. Define the steppable class with start and step methods.\n\nBut I think the user expects the traditional approach where the Python code is a steppable file, but the plugins are set up via XML. However, since they want the code to include everything, maybe we need to use the core specs.\n\nHere's an attempt:\n\nimport cc3d.CompuCellSetup as CompuCellSetup\nfrom cc3d.core.PyCoreSpecs import *\nfrom cc3d.core.PySteppables import *\n\n# Set up core specs\nspecs = CoreSpecs()\nspecs.register_plugin(type='Volume', initial_parameters={})\nspecs",
