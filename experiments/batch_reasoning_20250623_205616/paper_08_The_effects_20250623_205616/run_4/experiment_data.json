        "description": "There are numerous biological examples where genes associated with migratory ability of cells also confer the cells with an increased fitness even though these genes may not have any known effect on the cell mitosis rates. Here, we provide insight into these observations by analyzing the effects of cell migration, compression, and contact inhibition on the growth of tumor cell clusters using the Cellular Potts Model (CPM) in a monolayer geometry. This is a follow-up of a previous study (Thalhauser et al. 2010) in which a Moran-type model was used to study the interaction of cell proliferation, migratory potential and death on the emergence of invasive phenotypes. Here, we extend the study to include the effects of cell size and shape. In particular, we investigate the interplay between cell motility and compressibility within the CPM and find that the CPM predicts that increased cell motility leads to smaller cells. This is an artifact in the CPM. An analysis of the CPM reveals an explicit inverse-relationship between the cell stiffness and motility parameters. We use this relationship to compensate for motility-induced changes in cell size in the CPM so that in the corrected CPM, cell size is independent of the cell motility. We find that subject to comparable levels of compression, clusters of motile cells grow faster than clusters of less motile cells, in qualitative agreement with biological observations and our previous study. Increasing compression tends to reduce growth rates. Contact inhibition penalizes clumped cells by halting their growth and gives motile cells an even greater advantage. Finally, our model predicts cell size distributions that are consistent with those observed in clusters of neuroblastoma cells cultured in low and high density conditions."

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me tackle this ontology annotation task. The user wants a JSON object with CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH terms based on the provided biological description. First, I need to parse the original description to identify relevant terms.\n\nThe study mentions tumor cell clusters, so CellOntology might include terms like \"Tumor Cell\" or \"Neuroblastoma Cell\". Looking up Cell Ontology, CL:0001064 is \"Tumor Cell\". For neuroblastoma cells, CL:0005011 is \"Neuroblastoma Cell\". I'll add those.\n\nFor GeneOntology, the paper talks about cell migration, motility, proliferation, and contact inhibition. Checking GO terms: \"Cell Migration\" is GO:0016477, \"Cell Motility\" is GO:0006928, \"Cell Proliferation\" is GO:0008283, and \"Contact Inhibition\" might be under \"Cell-Cell Adhesion\" which is GO:0098609. Wait, contact inhibition specifically is part of contact inhibition of cell proliferation, which is GO:0060242. Let me confirm. Yes, GO:0060242 is \"contact inhibition of cell proliferation\". Also, \"Cell Division\" is GO:0051301. Need to check if \"Cell Growth\" is relevant. The study mentions growth rates, so GO:0040007 \"Growth\".\n\nMeSH terms: The topics here include cell movement (MeSH D002465), cell proliferation (D011747), cell adhesion (D015815), and maybe models like \"Cellular Potts Model\" but MeSH might have \"Models, Biological\" (D008954). Also, \"Neoplasms\" (D009369) for tumors. Contact inhibition could be under \"Contact Inhibition\" D003283. Let me verify. D003283 is indeed \"Contact Inhibition\". \n\nNow, structure the JSON with exact category names and IDs. Make sure no extra spaces in terms. Check each ID format. For example, CellOntology entries are CL: followed by numbers, GeneOntology GO: and MeSH D followed by six digits. \n\nDouble-check term names. \"Tumor Cell\", \"Neuroblastoma Cell\" for CellOntology. \"Cell Migration\", \"Cell Motility\", \"Cell Proliferation\", \"Contact Inhibition of Cell Proliferation\", \"Cell Division\", \"Growth\" for GeneOntology. MeSH terms: \"Cell Movement\", \"Cell Proliferation\", \"Contact Inhibition\", \"Neoplasms\", \"Models, Biological\". \n\nEnsure there are no typos. All IDs are correctly formatted without spaces. That should cover the key aspects of the study: cell migration, motility, proliferation, contact inhibition, tumor cells, models used, and related processes.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0001064\",\n            \"term\": \"TumorCell\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0005011\",\n            \"term\": \"NeuroblastomaCell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0016477\",\n            \"term\": \"CellMigration\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0006928\",\n            \"term\": \"CellMotility\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0008283\",\n            \"term\": \"CellProliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0060242\",\n            \"term\": \"ContactInhibition\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0051301\",\n            \"term\": \"CellDivision\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0040007\",\n            \"term\": \"Growth\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002465\",\n            \"term\": \"CellMovement\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D011747\",\n            \"term\": \"CellProliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D003283\",\n            \"term\": \"ContactInhibition\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D009369\",\n            \"term\": \"Neoplasms\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D008954\",\n            \"term\": \"Models,Biological\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"
