This is an artifact in the CPM. An analysis of the CPM reveals an explicit inverse-relationship between the cell stiffness and motility parameters. We use this relationship to compensate for motility-induced changes in cell size in the CPM so that in the corrected CPM, cell size is independent of the cell motility. We find that subject to comparable levels of compression, clusters of motile cells grow faster than clusters of less motile cells, in qualitative agreement with biological observations and our previous study. Increasing compression tends to reduce growth rates. Contact inhibition penalizes clumped cells by halting their growth and gives motile cells an even greater advantage.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me start by understanding the task. The user wants structured ontology annotations based on the provided biological modeling study. They need entries for CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH, each with specific IDs and terms.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the original description. The study involves tumor cell clusters, cell migration, motility, compression, contact inhibition, and the Cellular Potts Model (CPM). They mention neuroblastoma cells in the context of cell size distributions. \n\nFor CellOntology, the main cell type mentioned is neuroblastoma cells. The correct CL ID for neuroblastoma cell is CL:0005001. So I'll add that under CellOntology.\n\nNext, GeneOntology terms. The study discusses cell migration (GO:0016477), cell motility (GO:0006928), cell proliferation (GO:0008283), contact inhibition (GO:0060242), and cell death (GO:0008219). These terms are directly related to the processes analyzed in the model.\n\nFor MeSH, relevant terms include Cell Movement (D002465), Cell Proliferation (D049109), Neoplasm Invasiveness (D009361), Contact Inhibition (D003268), and Models, Biological (D008954). These mesh terms cover the main topics like migration, proliferation, invasiveness, contact inhibition, and the use of biological models like CPM.\n\nI need to ensure all IDs are correctly formatted without spaces, and terms are exact. Let me double-check each ontology database to confirm the IDs and term names. For example, Contact Inhibition in GO is GO:0060242, and in MeSH it's D003268. \n\nWait, the MeSH term for Contact Inhibition is actually D003268, right? Yes. And for Neoplasm Invasiveness, it's D009361. Also, Models, Biological is D008954. \n\nChecking Cell Ontology again, neuroblastoma cell is CL:0005001. Yes. \n\nGene Ontology terms: cell migration (GO:0016477), cell motility (GO:0006928), cell proliferation (GO:0008283), contact inhibition of cell population proliferation (GO:0060242), and cell death (GO:0008219).

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a CompuCell3D simulation Python file based on the given ontology annotations. Let's break down the requirements.\n\nFirst, the user wants the code to include required imports, a simulation class inheriting from SteppableBasePy, and the __init__, start, and step methods. Also, basic cell types and parameters based on the provided ontology.\n\nLooking at the ontology annotations: The cell type is Neuroblastoma. The GeneOntology terms include cell migration, death, contact inhibition, proliferation, motility. MeSH terms include biological models, proliferation, movement, contact inhibition, neoplasm invasiveness.\n\nSo the simulation should model neuroblastoma cells with behaviors like proliferation, death, migration, and contact inhibition. \n\nStarting with imports. I'll need CompuCellSetup, steppables, and maybe some modules like cc3d.CompuCell for cell death and volume parameters.\n\nNext, the simulation class. It should inherit from SteppableBasePy. In __init__, call the parent constructor. The start method will set up cell types and initialize cells. The step method will handle actions each simulation step, like checking for cell death or proliferation.\n\nFor cell types, create a Neuroblastoma type. Parameters to consider: volume (target volume, lambda), death rate, migration parameters (maybe adhesion or chemotaxis), contact inhibition (maybe via contact energy in the potential).\n\nIn the start method, set up the cell type using self.cellType. Then create some initial cells, maybe a blob of neuroblastoma cells.\n\nIn the step method, loop through each cell. Check if a cell should die (random chance based on a death rate). For proliferation, check if the cell's volume is above a threshold and then divide. Contact inhibition could be implemented by checking the number of neighbors; if too many, inhibit proliferation or movement.\n\nAlso, set up the contact energy in the Potts section. Neuroblastoma cells should have adhesion among themselves, maybe lower than their adhesion to the medium to promote migration.\n\nWait, contact inhibition usually means that cells stop proliferating when they are in contact. So in the step function, when evaluating proliferation, check if the cell has fewer neighbors than a threshold. If too many neighbors, don't allow division.\n\nAdditionally, for cell migration and motility, might need to set up a chemotaxis field or adjust adhesion parameters. But since the user asked for basic parameters, maybe just set up adhesion and volume constraints.\n\nPutting this together. Let's outline the code structure.\n\nImports: from cc3d import CompuCellSetup, steppables, cc3d\n\nThen, the simulation class. In start, define the cell type. In step, loop through cells and apply death, proliferation with contact inhibition.\n\nPotts parameters: dimensions, steps, temperature, neighbor order.\n\nVolume plugin: set target volume and lambda for neuroblastoma.\n\nContact energy: set between Neuroblastoma and Medium, and Neuroblastoma to Neuroblastoma. Maybe lower adhesion between cells to allow movement.\n\nDeath could be handled by checking a random number against a death probability each step. If yes, assign the cell's target volume to 0 to trigger removal.\n\nProliferation: if cell.volume > threshold and random check, then divide. But also check contact inhibition by counting neighbors. If neighbors < a certain number, allow division.\n\nSo in code:\n\nIn the step method:\n\nfor cell in self.cell_list:\n    if cell.type == self.neuroblastoma_type:\n        # Check for cell death\n        if random() < death_rate:\n            cell.targetVolume = 0\n        else:\n            # Check for proliferation with contact inhibition\n            if cell.volume > volume_threshold:\n                neighbors = len(self.get_cell_neighbor_data_list(cell))\n                if neighbors < contact_inhibition_threshold:\n                    cell.targetVolume += volume_increase\n                    # Divide if needed, or just let volume reach a point where it splits\n                    # Alternatively, use the divide cell method\n                    self.divide_cell_random_orientation(cell)\n\nBut wait, in CompuCell3D, cell division is usually handled by the Volume plugin when the volume exceeds a certain value. Alternatively, using the Mitosis steppable. But maybe for simplicity, just set targetVolume higher so that the cell grows and splits.\n\nAlternatively, in the step method, when conditions are met, manually trigger division. But the VolumeBasedGrowth plugin might handle splitting when volume reaches twice the target. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, use the built-in mitosis functionality. But to keep it simple, maybe just adjust targetVolume and let the volume plugin handle division. However, contact inhibition would require checking neighbor count before allowing growth.\n\nSo in the step method, for each neuroblastoma cell:\n\nif cell.volume > 50 (for example) and number of neighbors is less than, say, 3, then increase targetVolume to 100, leading to division. Otherwise, keep targetVolume at the base value.\n\nBut perhaps the initial targetVolume is 25, so when it's allowed to grow, it doubles to 50 and splits. Wait, the Volume plugin parameters need to be set correctly. The target volume is 25, lambda is 2.0. So cells try to maintain that volume. When they are allowed to grow, their targetVolume is increased, which causes them to grow until they split.\n\nAlternatively, use the Growth steppable, but maybe that's more complex.\n\nAlternatively, in the step method, if conditions are met (enough space), set cell.targetVolume += growth rate. Otherwise, set it back to the base targetVolume.\n\nBut this might require tracking the original target volume. Alternatively, use a flag.\n\nBut for simplicity, let's proceed with checking each cell's neighbors and allowing growth only if neighbors are below a threshold.\n\nPutting all this together, here's the code outline:\n\nimport ... \n\nclass NeuroblastomaSimulation(steppables.SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, frequency=1):\n        super().__init__(frequency)\n        self.neuroblastoma_type = None\n        self.death_rate = 0.001  # 0.1% chance per step\n        self.contact_inhibition_threshold = 3  # max neighbors allowed for proliferation\n        self.proliferation_volume_threshold = 25\n\n    def start(self):\n        # Define cell type\n        self.neuroblastoma_type = self.new_cell_type(\"Neuroblastoma\")\n        # Initial cell setup\n        cell = self.potts.createCell()\n        cell.type = self.neuroblastoma_type\n        self.cell_field[15:35, 15:35, 0] = cell  # Place a block of cells\n\n    def step(self, mcs):\n        for cell in self.cell_list:\n            if cell.type == self.neuroblastoma_type:\n                # Cell death\n                if random.random() < self.death_rate:\n                    cell.targetVolume = 0\n                    continue  # Skip further checks if cell is dead\n                # Contact inhibition and proliferation\n                if cell.volume > self.proliferation_volume_threshold:\n                    neighbor_count = len([nb for nb in self.get_cell_neighbor_data_list(cell) if nb and nb.type == self.neuroblastoma_type])\n                    if neighbor_count < self.contact_inhibition_threshold:\n                        cell.targetVolume += 2  # Allow growth\n\n        # Implicitly, the Volume plugin will handle volume changes and possible division when targetVolume is increased\n\nIn the start method, create a new cell type. Place a block of cells in the center.\n\nIn the step method, check each cell. If death occurs, set targetVolume to 0. For proliferation, check if volume is above threshold and neighbor count is below threshold, then increase targetVolume.\n\nNow, the Potts setup, volume, and contact parameters.\n\nIn the main code:\n\nCompuCellSetup.register_steppable(steppable=NeuroblastomaSimulation(frequency=1))\n\nThen, configure the simulation:\n\nfrom cc3d.core.XMLUtils import ElementCC3D\n\nCompuCell3DElmnt = ElementCC3D(\"CompuCell3D\")\npotts = CompuCell3DElmnt.ElementCC3D(\"Potts\")\npotts.ElementCC3D(\"Dimensions\", {\"x\": 50, \"y\": 50, \"z\": 1})\npotts.ElementCC3D(\"Steps\", {}, 1000)\npotts.ElementCC3D(\"Temperature\", {}, 10)\npotts.ElementCC3D(\"NeighborOrder\", {}, 2)\n\nvolume = CompuCell3DElmnt.ElementCC3D(\"Plugin\", {\"Name\": \"Volume\"})\nvolume.ElementCC3D(\"TargetVolume\", {}, 25)\nvolume.ElementCC3D(\"LambdaVolume\", {}, 2.0)\n\ncontact = CompuCell3DElmnt.ElementCC3D(\"Plugin\", {\"Name\": \"Contact\"})\ncontact.ElementCC3D(\"Energy\", {\"Type1\": \"Medium\", \"Type2\": \"Neuroblastoma\"}, 16)\ncontact.ElementCC3D(\"Energy\", {\"Type1\": \"Neuroblastoma\", \"Type2\": \"Neuroblastoma\"}, 10)\n\ndeath_plugin = CompuCell3DElmnt.ElementCC3D(\"Plugin\", {\"Name\": \"Apoptosis\"})\n\nCompuCellSetup.set_simulation_xml_description(CompuCell3DElmnt)\n\nBut wait, the Apoptosis plugin might not be necessary if we handle death by setting targetVolume to "

If neighbors < a certain number, allow division.\n\nSo in code:\n\nIn the step method:\n\nfor cell in self.cell_list:\n    if cell.type == self.neuroblastoma_type:\n        # Check for cell death\n        if random() < death_rate:\n            cell.targetVolume = 0\n        else:\n            # Check for proliferation with contact inhibition\n            if cell.volume > volume_threshold:\n                neighbors = len(self.get_cell_neighbor_data_list(cell))\n                if neighbors < contact_inhibition_threshold:\n                    cell.targetVolume += volume_increase\n                    # Divide if needed, or just let volume reach a point where it splits\n                    # Alternatively, use the divide cell method\n                    self.divide_cell_random_orientation(cell)\n\nBut wait, in CompuCell3D, cell division is usually handled by the Volume plugin when the volume exceeds a certain value. Alternatively, using the Mitosis steppable. But maybe for simplicity, just set targetVolume higher so that the cell grows and splits.\n\nAlternatively, in the step method, when conditions are met, manually trigger division. But the VolumeBasedGrowth plugin might handle splitting when volume reaches twice the target. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, use the built-in mitosis functionality. But to keep it simple, maybe just adjust targetVolume and let the volume plugin handle division. However, contact inhibition would require checking neighbor count before allowing growth.\n\nSo in the step method, for each neuroblastoma cell:\n\nif cell.volume > 50 (for example) and number of neighbors is less than, say, 3, then increase targetVolume to 100, leading to division. Otherwise, keep targetVolume at the base value.\n\nBut perhaps the initial targetVolume is 25, so when it's allowed to grow, it doubles to 50 and splits. Wait, the Volume plugin parameters need to be set correctly. The target volume is 25, lambda is 2.0. So cells try to maintain that volume. When they are allowed to grow, their targetVolume is increased, which causes them to grow until they split.\n\nAlternatively, use the Growth steppable, but maybe that's more complex.\n\nAlternatively, in the step method, if conditions are met (enough space), set cell.targetVolume += growth rate. Otherwise, set it back to the base targetVolume.\n\nBut this might require tracking the original target volume. Alternatively, use a flag.\n\nBut for simplicity, let's proceed with checking each cell's neighbors and allowing growth only if neighbors are below a threshold.\n\nPutting all this together, here's the code outline:\n\nimport ... \n\nclass NeuroblastomaSimulation(steppables.SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, frequency=1):\n        super().__init__(frequency)\n        self.neuroblastoma_type = None\n        self.death_rate = 0.001  # 0.1% chance per step\n        self.contact_inhibition_threshold = 3  # max neighbors allowed for proliferation\n        self.proliferation_volume_threshold = 25\n\n    def start(self):\n        # Define cell type\n        self.neuroblastoma_type = self.new_cell_type(\"Neuroblastoma\")\n        # Initial cell setup\n        cell = self.potts.createCell()\n        cell.type = self.neuroblastoma_type\n        self.cell_field[15:35, 15:35, 0] = cell  # Place a block of cells\n\n    def step(self, mcs):\n        for cell in self.cell_list:\n            if cell.type == self.neuroblastoma_type:\n                # Cell death\n                if random.random() < self.death_rate:\n                    cell.targetVolume = 0\n                    continue  # Skip further checks if cell is dead\n                # Contact inhibition and proliferation\n                if cell.volume > self.proliferation_volume_threshold:\n                    neighbor_count = len([nb for nb in self.get_cell_neighbor_data_list(cell) if nb and nb.type == self.neuroblastoma_type])\n                    if neighbor_count < self.contact_inhibition_threshold:\n                        cell.targetVolume += 2  # Allow growth\n\n        # Implicitly, the Volume plugin will handle volume changes and possible division when targetVolume is increased\n\nIn the start method, create a new cell type. Place a block of cells in the center.\n\nIn the step method, check each cell. If death occurs, set targetVolume to 0. For proliferation, check if volume is above threshold and neighbor count is below threshold, then increase targetVolume.\n\nNow, the Potts setup, volume, and contact parameters.\n\nIn the main code:\n\nCompuCellSetup.register_steppable(steppable=NeuroblastomaSimulation(frequency=1))\n\nThen, configure the simulation:\n\nfrom cc3d.core.XMLUtils import ElementCC3D\n\nCompuCell3DElmnt = ElementCC3D(\"CompuCell3D\")\npotts = CompuCell3DElmnt.ElementCC3D(\"Potts\")\npotts.ElementCC3D(\"Dimensions\", {\"x\": 50, \"y\": 50, \"z\": 1})\npotts.ElementCC3D(\"Steps\", {}, 1000)\npotts.ElementCC3D(\"Temperature\", {}, 10)\npotts.ElementCC3D(\"NeighborOrder\", {}, 2)\n\nvolume = CompuCell3DElmnt.ElementCC3D(\"Plugin\", {\"Name\": \"Volume\"})\nvolume.ElementCC3D(\"TargetVolume\", {}, 25)\nvolume.ElementCC3D(\"LambdaVolume\", {}, 2.0)\n\ncontact = CompuCell3DElmnt.ElementCC3D(\"Plugin\", {\"Name\": \"Contact\"})\ncontact.ElementCC3D(\"Energy\", {\"Type1\": \"Medium\", \"Type2\": \"Neuroblastoma\"}, 16)\ncontact.ElementCC3D(\"Energy\", {\"Type1\": \"Neuroblastoma\", \"Type2\": \"Neuroblastoma\"}, 10)\n\ndeath_plugin = CompuCell3DElmnt.ElementCC3D(\"Plugin\", {\"Name\": \"Apoptosis\"})\n\nCompuCellSetup.set_simulation_xml_description(CompuCell3DElmnt)\n\nBut wait, the Apoptosis plugin might not be necessary if we handle death by setting targetVolume to",
