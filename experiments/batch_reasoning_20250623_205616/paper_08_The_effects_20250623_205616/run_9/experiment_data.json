        "description": "There are numerous biological examples where genes associated with migratory ability of cells also confer the cells with an increased fitness even though these genes may not have any known effect on the cell mitosis rates. Here, we provide insight into these observations by analyzing the effects of cell migration, compression, and contact inhibition on the growth of tumor cell clusters using the Cellular Potts Model (CPM) in a monolayer geometry. This is a follow-up of a previous study (Thalhauser et al. 2010) in which a Moran-type model was used to study the interaction of cell proliferation, migratory potential and death on the emergence of invasive phenotypes. Here, we extend the study to include the effects of cell size and shape. In particular, we investigate the interplay between cell motility and compressibility within the CPM and find that the CPM predicts that increased cell motility leads to smaller cells. This is an artifact in the CPM. An analysis of the CPM reveals an explicit inverse-relationship between the cell stiffness and motility parameters. We use this relationship to compensate for motility-induced changes in cell size in the CPM so that in the corrected CPM, cell size is independent of the cell motility. We find that subject to comparable levels of compression, clusters of motile cells grow faster than clusters of less motile cells, in qualitative agreement with biological observations and our previous study. Increasing compression tends to reduce growth rates. Contact inhibition penalizes clumped cells by halting their growth and gives motile cells an even greater advantage. Finally, our model predicts cell size distributions that are consistent with those observed in clusters of neuroblastoma cells cultured in low and high density conditions."

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by breaking down the original description to identify relevant terms for each ontology category. \n\nFirst, for Cell Ontology (CellOntology), the text mentions tumor cell clusters and neuroblastoma cells. Neuroblastoma cells are a specific cell type, so I need to find the correct CL ID. Checking the Cell Ontology, neuroblastoma cells should be CL:0002319. The term is \"Neuroblastoma Cell\".\n\nNext, Gene Ontology (GeneOntology). The study talks about cell migration, motility, proliferation, contact inhibition, and cell size regulation. Relevant GO terms might include \"Cell Migration\" (GO:0016477), \"Cell Motility\" (GO:0048870), \"Cell Proliferation\" (GO:0008283), \"Contact Inhibition\" (GO:0060242), and \"Regulation of Cell Size\" (GO:0008361). I need to verify each ID. Wait, \"Contact Inhibition\" is sometimes referred to as \"Contact Inhibition of Cell Proliferation\" with GO:0060242. Similarly, \"Regulation of Cell Size\" is indeed GO:0008361. \"Cell Migration\" and \"Cell Motility\" are separate terms; migration is a child term of motility, but the exact IDs should be checked. Let me confirm: GO:0016477 is \"Cell Migration\", and GO:0048870 is \"Cell Motility\". \"Cell Proliferation\" is GO:0008283. That's correct.\n\nFor MeSH terms, the topics include cell movement, cell proliferation, contact inhibition, and neoplasms. MeSH terms would be \"Cell Movement\" (D002465), \"Cell Proliferation\" (D049109), \"Contact Inhibition\" (D018908), and \"Neoplasms\" (D009369). Need to check each MeSH ID. D002465 is \"Cell Movement\", D049109 is \"Cell Proliferation\", D018908 is \"Contact Inhibition\", and D009369 is \"Neoplasms\". Also mentioned is the Cellular Potts Model, but MeSH might not have a specific term for that. However, the study is about tumor growth, so \"Neoplasms\" fits. \n\nEnsure all IDs are correctly formatted without spaces. Terms must match exactly as per the ontologies. For example, \"Contact Inhibition\" is the term for MeSH D018908, and \"Cell Proliferation\" for MeSH D049109. \n\nDouble-check each ID and term to avoid any formatting issues.

Basic cell types and parameters based on the ontology annotations",
      "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a CompuCell3D simulation Python file based on the given ontology annotations. Let me start by understanding what's required here.\n\nFirst, the user specified several Cell Ontology terms, specifically Neuroblastoma Cells. For Gene Ontology, there's Regulation of Cell Size, Cell Migration, Contact Inhibition, Cell Motility, and Cell Proliferation. The MeSH terms include Neoplasms, Contact Inhibition, Cell Proliferation, and Cell Movement. \n\nThe code must include imports, a simulation class inheriting from SteppableBasePy, and the __init__, start, and step methods. Also, basic cell types and parameters based on the ontology annotations.\n\nStarting with the imports. CompuCellSetup is necessary, and from cc3d.core.PySteppables import SteppableBasePy, maybe other modules like LengthConstraint or Chemotaxis if needed.\n\nThe simulation class should inherit from SteppableBasePy. The __init__ method needs to call the parent's __init__. The start method is where initializations happen, like setting up cells. The step method handles actions each simulation step.\n\nFor cell types, the main one is Neuroblastoma. Maybe define other types for the environment, like a default or stromal cells. But the user only mentioned Neuroblastoma, so maybe just that.\n\nParameters based on the ontology: Cell proliferation could be handled by setting a target volume and using VolumeEnergy in the CC3DML. Wait, but the code is Python, so maybe using the LengthConstraint plugin for cell size regulation. For contact inhibition, set appropriate contact energies. Cell motility might involve using the Chemotaxis plugin or setting up a random movement.\n\nWait, in CompuCell3D, cell behaviors are often controlled via plugins. So in the XML (CC3DML), you'd configure plugins like Volume, Contact, Chemotaxis, etc. But since the user wants the Python code, maybe they want the parameters set via the Python interface.\n\nSo, in the start method, I should set the target volume and lambda for volume constraint. For contact inhibition, set the contact energy between cells. For motility, maybe set a chemotaxis parameter towards a chemical gradient, but if there's no chemical field, maybe use a random movement using the FlexibleDiffusionSolverFE?\n\nWait, the example needs to be self-contained. Let's think of the necessary plugins. Volume for cell size regulation, Contact for adhesion/contact inhibition, and maybe Chemotaxis for migration.\n\nBut in the Python code, how are these plugins initialized? Typically, the CC3DML file would include them, but since we're generating a Python script, perhaps the user expects using the simulation's XML writer. Alternatively, maybe using the built-in setup in Python.\n\nWait, the user said \"Return ONLY the Python code without any additional text...\". So the code must include all necessary parts, possibly using the cc3d.CompuCellSetup.register_steppable method, and configuring the simulation via the XML.\n\nBut in the Python script, sometimes the XML is generated via the script. Alternatively, maybe the code uses the core Python API to set parameters directly.\n\nLet me structure the code:\n\nImports:\nimport CompuCellSetup\nfrom cc3d.core.PySteppables import *\n\nSimulation class:\nclass NeuroblastomaSimulation(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, frequency=1):\n        super().__init__(frequency)\n\n    def start(self):\n        # Initialize cells here\n        cell_type = self.cell_type\n        # Maybe create a cell field, like a blob of cells\n\n    def step(self, mcs):\n        # Handle cell proliferation, migration, etc. each step\n\nBut how to set up the cell types and plugins? Maybe in the start method, configure the parameters.\n\nFor cell proliferation, each cell type has a target volume and parameters for growth. Also, contact inhibition would involve setting contact energy between cells higher than cell-medium contact.\n\nIn the start method:\n\nself.cell_type.Neuroblastoma.target_volume = 25\nself.cell_type.Neuroblastoma.lambda_volume = 2.0\n\nFor contact energy, perhaps:\n\nself.contact_energy_between(self.cell_type.Neuroblastoma, self.cell_type.Neuroblastoma, 20)\nself.contact_energy_between(self.cell_type.Neuroblastoma, self.cell_type.MEDIUM, 10)\n\nBut the MEDIUM is a default type. Need to define cell types.\n\nIn the start method, perhaps define cell_types:\n\ncell_type_neuro = self.add_cell_type(\"Neuroblastoma\")\ncell_type_medium = self.add_cell_type(\"Medium\")\n\nBut in CompuCell3D's Python API, you can access the cell types via the simulator.\n\nAlternatively, using the XML-based configuration. Wait, perhaps in the start method, they can set the parameters via the plugin API.\n\nBut maybe the code should include setting up the volume plugin parameters. For example:\n\nvolume_plugin = self.get_xml_element('Volume')\nvolume_plugin.Neuroblastoma.TargetVolume=25\nvolume_plugin.Neuroblastoma.LambdaVolume=2.0\n\nSimilarly for contact plugin:\n\ncontact_plugin = self.get_xml_element('Contact')\ncontact_plugin.set_energy('Neuroblastoma','Neuroblastoma', 20)\ncontact_plugin.set_energy('Neuroblastoma','Medium', 10)\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the correct way in the Python API. Alternatively, using the built-in functions like self.cellTypeParameters.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should use the cellField to create cells. For example, in start():\n\nfor x in range(100, 200):\n    for y in range(100, 200):\n        cell = self.new_cell(self.NEUROBLASTOMA)\n        self.cell_field[x,y,0] = cell\n\nBut then, need to define the cell types. The user's ontology has Neuroblastoma as the main cell type. So maybe define that type, and medium.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe code starts with imports, then defines the simulation class with start, step. In start, they initialize the cell field, set parameters for volume, contact, etc.\n\nFor cell migration, maybe add a chemotaxis plugin. For example, cells move towards a chemical gradient. So in the start method, setup a chemical field and chemotaxis parameters.\n\nBut the user's ontology includes Cell Migration and Motility, so perhaps chemotaxis is a way to model that. So setup a chemical field (e.g., a diffusion field), and set chemotaxis parameters.\n\nBut since the user wants a basic example, maybe the code includes a simple setup with volume, contact, and chemotaxis.\n\nSo, here's a possible outline:\n\nImports: CompuCellSetup, SteppableBasePy, maybe others.\n\nclass NeuroblastomaSimulation(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, frequency=1):\n        super().__init__(frequency)\n        self.NEUROBLASTOMA = 1\n        self.MEDIUM = 0\n\n    def start(self):\n        # Setup cell parameters\n        self.set_volume_parameters()\n        self.set_contact_parameters()\n        self.setup_cells()\n        self.setup_chemotaxis()\n\n    def set_volume_parameters(self):\n        vol_plugin = self.get_xml_element('Volume')\n        vol_plugin.Neuroblastoma.TargetVolume = 25\n        vol_plugin.Neuroblastoma.LambdaVolume = 2.0\n\n    def set_contact_parameters(self):\n        contact_plugin = self.get_xml_element('Contact')\n        contact_plugin.set_energy('Neuroblastoma', 'Neuroblastoma', 20)\n        contact_plugin.set_energy('Neuroblastoma', 'Medium', 10)\n\n    def setup_cells(self):\n        # Create a layer of cells\n        for x in range(100, 150):\n            for y in range(100, 150):\n                cell = self.new_cell(self.NEUROBLASTOMA)\n                self.cell_field[x, y, 0] = cell\n\n    def setup_chemotaxis(self):\n        # Add a chemical field and chemotaxis parameters\n        chemical_field = self.create_chemical_field(\"ATTR\")\n        chemotaxis_plugin = self.get_xml_element('Chemotaxis')\n        chemo_params = chemotaxis_plugin.add_chemical_field(chemical_field)\n        chemo_params.add_cell_type(self.NEUROBLASTOMA, 10) # lambda\n\n    def step(self, mcs):\n        # Proliferation: divide cells based on some condition\n        for cell in self.cell_list:\n            if cell.volume > 30:\n                self.divide_cell_random_orientation(cell)\n\nBut I'm not sure if the XML elements are accessed that way. Maybe in CompuCell3D's Python API, you have to use the Simulator's XML generator.\n\nAlternatively, in the start method, the code can set up the parameters using the XML elements.\n\nAlso, for the cell types, in CompuCell3D, you need to define them in the XML. So perhaps in the start method, the code uses:\n\nself.add_cell_type(\"Neuroblastoma\")\n\nBut maybe that's handled automatically when creating cells.\n\nAlternatively, in the XML part, you need to define the cell types. Since the user wants Python code, perhaps using the following approach:\n\nIn"

Need to define cell types.\n\nIn the start method, perhaps define cell_types:\n\ncell_type_neuro = self.add_cell_type(\"Neuroblastoma\")\ncell_type_medium = self.add_cell_type(\"Medium\")\n\nBut in CompuCell3D's Python API, you can access the cell types via the simulator.\n\nAlternatively, using the XML-based configuration. Wait, perhaps in the start method, they can set the parameters via the plugin API.\n\nBut maybe the code should include setting up the volume plugin parameters. For example:\n\nvolume_plugin = self.get_xml_element('Volume')\nvolume_plugin.Neuroblastoma.TargetVolume=25\nvolume_plugin.Neuroblastoma.LambdaVolume=2.0\n\nSimilarly for contact plugin:\n\ncontact_plugin = self.get_xml_element('Contact')\ncontact_plugin.set_energy('Neuroblastoma','Neuroblastoma', 20)\ncontact_plugin.set_energy('Neuroblastoma','Medium', 10)\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the correct way in the Python API. Alternatively, using the built-in functions like self.cellTypeParameters.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should use the cellField to create cells. For example, in start():\n\nfor x in range(100, 200):\n    for y in range(100, 200):\n        cell = self.new_cell(self.NEUROBLASTOMA)\n        self.cell_field[x,y,0] = cell\n\nBut then, need to define the cell types. The user's ontology has Neuroblastoma as the main cell type. So maybe define that type, and medium.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe code starts with imports, then defines the simulation class with start, step. In start, they initialize the cell field, set parameters for volume, contact, etc.\n\nFor cell migration, maybe add a chemotaxis plugin. For example, cells move towards a chemical gradient. So in the start method, setup a chemical field and chemotaxis parameters.\n\nBut the user's ontology includes Cell Migration and Motility, so perhaps chemotaxis is a way to model that. So setup a chemical field (e.g., a diffusion field), and set chemotaxis parameters.\n\nBut since the user wants a basic example, maybe the code includes a simple setup with volume, contact, and chemotaxis.\n\nSo, here's a possible outline:\n\nImports: CompuCellSetup, SteppableBasePy, maybe others.\n\nclass NeuroblastomaSimulation(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, frequency=1):\n        super().__init__(frequency)\n        self.NEUROBLASTOMA = 1\n        self.MEDIUM = 0\n\n    def start(self):\n        # Setup cell parameters\n        self.set_volume_parameters()\n        self.set_contact_parameters()\n        self.setup_cells()\n        self.setup_chemotaxis()\n\n    def set_volume_parameters(self):\n        vol_plugin = self.get_xml_element('Volume')\n        vol_plugin.Neuroblastoma.TargetVolume = 25\n        vol_plugin.Neuroblastoma.LambdaVolume = 2.0\n\n    def set_contact_parameters(self):\n        contact_plugin = self.get_xml_element('Contact')\n        contact_plugin.set_energy('Neuroblastoma', 'Neuroblastoma', 20)\n        contact_plugin.set_energy('Neuroblastoma', 'Medium', 10)\n\n    def setup_cells(self):\n        # Create a layer of cells\n        for x in range(100, 150):\n            for y in range(100, 150):\n                cell = self.new_cell(self.NEUROBLASTOMA)\n                self.cell_field[x, y, 0] = cell\n\n    def setup_chemotaxis(self):\n        # Add a chemical field and chemotaxis parameters\n        chemical_field = self.create_chemical_field(\"ATTR\")\n        chemotaxis_plugin = self.get_xml_element('Chemotaxis')\n        chemo_params = chemotaxis_plugin.add_chemical_field(chemical_field)\n        chemo_params.add_cell_type(self.NEUROBLASTOMA, 10) # lambda\n\n    def step(self, mcs):\n        # Proliferation: divide cells based on some condition\n        for cell in self.cell_list:\n            if cell.volume > 30:\n                self.divide_cell_random_orientation(cell)\n\nBut I'm not sure if the XML elements are accessed that way. Maybe in CompuCell3D's Python API, you have to use the Simulator's XML generator.\n\nAlternatively, in the start method, the code can set up the parameters using the XML elements.\n\nAlso, for the cell types, in CompuCell3D, you need to define them in the XML. So perhaps in the start method, the code uses:\n\nself.add_cell_type(\"Neuroblastoma\")\n\nBut maybe that's handled automatically when creating cells.\n\nAlternatively, in the XML part, you need to define the cell types. Since the user wants Python code, perhaps using the following approach:\n\nIn",
