Here, we provide insight into these observations by analyzing the effects of cell migration, compression, and contact inhibition on the growth of tumor cell clusters using the Cellular Potts Model (CPM) in a monolayer geometry. This is a follow-up of a previous study (Thalhauser et al. 2010) in which a Moran-type model was used to study the interaction of cell proliferation, migratory potential and death on the emergence of invasive phenotypes. Here, we extend the study to include the effects of cell size and shape. In particular, we investigate the interplay between cell motility and compressibility within the CPM and find that the CPM predicts that increased cell motility leads to smaller cells. This is an artifact in the CPM. An analysis of the CPM reveals an explicit inverse-relationship between the cell stiffness and motility parameters. We use this relationship to compensate for motility-induced changes in cell size in the CPM so that in the corrected CPM, cell size is independent of the cell motility. We find that subject to comparable levels of compression, clusters of motile cells grow faster than clusters of less motile cells, in qualitative agreement with biological observations and our previous study. Increasing compression tends to reduce growth rates. Contact inhibition penalizes clumped cells by halting their growth and gives motile cells an even greater advantage. Finally, our model predicts cell size distributions that are consistent with those observed in clusters of neuroblastoma cells cultured in low and high density conditions."

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a JSON object with ontology annotations based on the provided information. The user wants CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH terms where applicable. Let me start by parsing the original description and the clarifications given.\n\nFirst, the study talks about tumor cell clusters, cell migration, motility, compression, contact inhibition, and growth rates. The Cellular Potts Model (CPM) is used here. They mention neuroblastoma cells cultured in different densities. \n\nFor CellOntology, tumor cells might be relevant. The term \"Tumor Cell\" has the CL ID CL:0001064. Also, neuroblastoma cells are mentioned, which are a type of neural crest cell. Checking Cell Ontology, \"Neuroblastoma Cell\" isn't a standard term, but \"Neural Crest Cell\" is CL:0002323. Alternatively, maybe \"Malignant Cell\" is CL:0001063. Since the context is tumor clusters, \"Tumor Cell\" seems appropriate. But the example uses \"Epithelial\" and \"Mesenchymal\", which are specific. However, the text doesn't mention those. Wait, the original description focuses on tumor cells, especially neuroblastoma. Maybe \"Neuroblastoma Cell\" isn't a CL term. Let me verify. CL:0001063 is \"malignant cell\", which is a parent term for cancer cells. So perhaps \"malignant cell\" is better. Alternatively, if there's a specific term for neuroblastoma cells, but I think CL might not have that. So maybe CL:0001063 for malignant cell.\n\nGeneOntology terms: The study involves cell migration (GO:0016477), cell motility (GO:0048870), cell proliferation (GO:0008283), contact inhibition (GO:0060242), and cell death (GO:0008219). Also, cell size regulation (GO:0008361) and cell shape (GO:0016049). The model involves cell growth, so maybe \"cell population proliferation\" (GO:0008283). The analysis of the CPM might relate to \"computational modeling\" (GO:0034626). The study also mentions cell stiffness, which relates to \"cell stiffness involved in cell motility\" (GO:0097713). But need to check if these terms exist. For example, contact inhibition of proliferation is GO:0060242. Cell migration is GO:0016477. Cell motility is a synonym for cell migration, so maybe just use the migration term. But the text mentions both motility and migration. Wait, GO:0048870 is \"cell motility\", which is the same as cell migration. So perhaps use that. Cell proliferation is GO:0008283. Contact inhibition is GO:0060242. Cell size regulation is GO:0008361. Cell shape is GO:0016049. The study also mentions cell death, so apoptosis (GO:0006915) or programmed cell death. But the text refers to cell death in general, so maybe GO:0008219 (cell death). The Cellular Potts Model is a computational model, so GO:0034626 (cellular computational modeling). The interaction between cell proliferation, motility, and death might involve terms like \"regulation of cell population proliferation\" (GO:0040007), but maybe stick to the main terms mentioned.\n\nMeSH terms: The topics include Cell Movement (D002465), Cell Proliferation (D049109), Neoplasm Metastasis (D009362), Contact Inhibition (D018908), Cell Death (D016923), Models, Biological (D008954), and Neuroblastoma (D009447). The study uses a model (CPM) so Models, Biological is D008954. Cell migration and motility would map to Cell Movement (D002465). Tumor cell clusters relate to Neoplasm Metastasis (D009362). Contact Inhibition is a specific MeSH term D018908. Cell Death is D016923. Neuroblastoma is D009447. Also, Cell Proliferation is D049109. The Cellular Potts Model might be under Models, Biological. The analysis of growth rates could relate to Cell Proliferation. Compression effects might not have a direct MeSH term, but the study's focus is on tumor growth, so maybe Neoplasm Growth (D018303), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, stick to the terms explicitly mentioned.\n\nNow, need to ensure the IDs are correct. Check each term:\n\nCellOntology:\n- Malignant Cell: CL:0001063\n- Tumor Cell: CL:0001064 (depends on context; CL:0001064 is \"tumor cell\", but sometimes \"malignant cell\" is used. Since the study is on tumor cell clusters, maybe use CL:0001064. Wait, CL:0001064 is \"tumor cell\". Yes. So \"Tumor Cell\" with CL:0001064. Also, neuroblastoma cells are a type of tumor cell, so maybe include both? But the example in the prompt uses one term per category. The original text mentions neuroblastoma cells, but CL doesn't have a specific term for that. So maybe just Tumor Cell.\n\nGeneOntology:\n- Cell migration: GO:0016477 (cell migration)\n- Cell motility: GO:0048870 (cell motility)\nWait, but are these distinct? Checking, GO:0016477 is \"cell migration\", which is a child of cell motility (GO:0048870). But the text mentions both \"migratory ability\" and \"motility\". Maybe include both, but the terms might be redundant. Alternatively, use the parent term. However, the example in the prompt uses \"Cell Division\" as a term. Let me check exact terms. The term \"cell motility\" exists as GO:0048870. So include that. Also, cell proliferation is GO:0008283. Contact inhibition of cell proliferation is GO:0060242. Cell death is GO:0008219. Cell size regulation: GO:0008361. Cell shape: GO:0016049. Computational modeling: GO:0034626. Also, \"cell stiffness involved in cell motility\" is GO:0097713. The study mentions cell stiffness and motility parameters, so that term might be relevant. \n\nMeSH:\n- Cell Movement: D002465\n- Cell Proliferation: D049109\n- Neoplasm Metastasis: D009362\n- Contact Inhibition: D018908\n- Cell Death: D016923\n- Models, Biological: D008954\n- Neuroblastoma: D009447\n\nSo putting this together, the JSON should have these terms under each category. Need to check for exact term names and IDs. For example, \"Contact Inhibition\" in MeSH is the exact term, but in GeneOntology it's \"contact inhibition of cell proliferation\". Need to confirm the exact term names.\n\nWait, for GeneOntology's contact inhibition: GO:0060242 is \"contact inhibition of cell proliferation\". The term name should be exactly as in the ontology. So the term is \"contact inhibition of cell proliferation\". The MeSH term is \"Contact Inhibition\", which is D018908. \n\nSimilarly, \"cell motility\" is GO:0048870. \"Cell migration\" is GO:0016477. The text mentions both migratory ability and motility, so perhaps include both. \n\nThe study uses the Cellular Potts Model, which is a computational model, so GO:0034626 \"cellular computational modeling\". \n\nThe cell size and shape: cell size regulation (GO:0008361) and cell morphogenesis (GO:0000902), but the text mentions cell size and shape. GO:0016049 is \"cell growth\", but maybe \"cell size\" is GO:0040007 (regulation of cell size). Wait, GO:0008361 is \"regulation of cell size\". So include that. Cell shape might be \"cell morphogenesis\" (GO:0000902) or \"cell shape\" (GO:0008361). Wait, GO:0016049 is \"cell growth\". Hmm, maybe check. GO:0008361 is \"regulation of cell size\", and GO:0016049 is \"cell growth\". Alternatively, \"cell morphogenesis\" (GO:0000902) is the process of shaping a cell. But the study talks about cell size and shape, so maybe include both regulation of cell size (GO:0008361) and cell morphogenesis (GO:0000902). But need to verify the exact terms.\n\nIn the original text: \"effects of cell size and shape\", \"cell size distributions\", \"cell stiffness and motility parameters\". So for GeneOntology, terms related to cell size (regulation of cell size, GO:0008361), cell shape (cell morphogenesis, GO:0000902), cell stiffness (GO:0097713 cell stiffness involved in cell motility), cell motility (GO:0048870), cell migration (GO:0016477), contact inhibition (GO:0060242), cell proliferation (GO:0008283), cell death (GO:0008219), computational modeling (GO:0034626).\n\nFor MeSH, include Cell Movement (D002465), Cell Proliferation (D049109), Neoplasm Metastasis (D009362), Contact Inhibition (D018908), Cell Death (D016923), Models, Biological (D008954), and Neuroblastoma (D009447).\n\nCellOntology: Tumor Cell (CL:0001064), and possibly Malignant Cell (CL:0001063). But since the study is"

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants me to generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation Python file based on the given ontology annotations. Let me check the requirements again.\n\nThe code must include the necessary imports: CompuCellSetup and steppables. Then, a simulation class that inherits from steppable.SteppableBasePy. The required methods are __init__, start, and step. Also, basic cell types and parameters based on the ontology annotations provided. But looking at the ontology annotations, all sets are empty. So, maybe they just need a basic template without specific cell types or genes.\n\nWait, even if the ontology sets are empty, the code still needs to include basic cell types. Since the user didn't specify any, perhaps I should define a default one, like 'CellType'. Also, parameters like volume and contact energy might be needed.\n\nLet me structure the code. Start with importing CompuCellSetup and the steppables module. Then, create a simulation class inheriting from SteppableBasePy. In the __init__ method, call the parent's __init__. The start method will initialize cells, maybe place a cell in the center. The step method could do something simple, like check the cell's volume each step.\n\nI need to set up the simulation with basic parameters. Use CompuCellSetup.register_steppable to register the class. Define the cell types in the start method using self.cellField. Maybe add a line to instantiate the steppable with the simulation.\n\nAlso, the XML file is needed, but the user didn't mention it. Since they want the Python code only, maybe the code includes a line to run the simulation with an empty XML. Wait, CompuCellSetup usually requires a configuration XML. But in some cases, you can generate it programmatically. However, the simplest way is to provide a minimal XML setup. But the user said to return only Python code. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code uses a default simulation setup. Let me check the standard CompuCell3D Python script structure. Typically, you import the necessary modules, define the steppable class, and then register it. The rest is handled via the XML. But since the user didn't provide an XML, maybe the code uses a Simulation object created within Python. However, that's more complex. The standard approach is to have an XML. But the user might expect that the code is self-contained, perhaps generating the XML via Python. But that's advanced.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says to generate the Python code that would be part of a simulation file. So perhaps the XML is separate, and the Python code is the steppable. So in the code, the user would have the imports, the simulation class, and the registration. Let me proceed with that.\n\nIn the start method, initialize a cell. Maybe using self.cell_field[0,0,0].newCell(...). Then set the type. For parameters, volume and lambda in the step method. Also, contact energy in the simulator.\n\nWait, contact energy is usually set in the XML's Plugin/Contact. But since the user wants the code in Python, maybe the code uses the ContactInternalPlugin to set contact energies. But how to do that in Python? Alternatively, maybe the code uses the simulator object to set contact energies. Let me think.\n\nIn CompuCell3D's Python API, you can access the contact energy parameters via the simulator. So in the start method, after initializing the cell types, you can set the contact energy between cell types using something like self.get_xml_element('Contact'). Then, set the energy. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the code defines a basic contact energy between the cell type and Medium.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user just needs the minimal code without contact energies, but the question mentions 'basic cell parameters' so volume and contact might be necessary.\n\nBut given the ontology annotations are empty, maybe just a simple setup. Let me proceed to write the code with a basic structure, initializing a cell, setting volume constraints, and contact energy between the cell type and medium.\n\nWait, but how to set contact energy in Python? Maybe through the simulator object. For example:\n\nsimulator = CompuCellSetup.simulator\nsimulator.getPotts().setCellFluctuationAmplitude(10)\ncontact_plugin = simulator.getPlugin('Contact')\ncontact_plugin.setEnergy('CellType', 'Medium', 16)\n\nBut how to include that in the code. Let me check the CompuCell3D documentation.\n\nYes, in the start method, you can access the simulator and plugins. So adding code like:\n\nsimulator = CompuCellSetup.simulator\ncontact_plugin = simulator.getPlugin('Contact')\ncontact_plugin.setEnergy('CellType', 'Medium', 16)\n\nSo integrating that into the start method.\n\nPutting it all together: The code imports CompuCellSetup and steppables. The simulation class has __init__, start, and step methods. In start, define cell types, set contact energies, create a cell. In step, adjust cell target volume or something. The XML is not part of the code, but the code is the Python part.\n\nSo the final code would look something like:\n\nimport sys\nfrom PyQt5 import QtCore, QtGui\nfrom cc3d import CompuCellSetup\nfrom cc3d.core.PySteppables import *\n\nclass SimulationSteppable(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, frequency=1):\n        super().__init__(frequency)\n\n    def start(self):\n        # Define cell types\n        self.cell_type = self.create_new_cell_type(\"CellType\")\n        # Set contact energy\n        simulator = CompuCellSetup.simulator\n        contact_plugin = simulator.getPlugin('Contact')\n        contact_plugin.setEnergy(\"CellType\", \"Medium\", 16)\n        # Create a cell\n        cell = self.new_cell(self.cell_type)\n        self.cell_field[50,50,50] = cell\n        # Set volume parameters\n        self.add_cell_type_volume_parameters(\"CellType\", target_volume=25, lambda_volume=2.0)\n\n    def step(self, mcs):\n        for cell in self.cell_list:\n            if cell.volume > 25:\n                cell.targetVolume = 25\n            else:\n                cell.targetVolume = 25\n\nCompuCellSetup.register_steppable(steppable=SimulationSteppable(frequency=1))\nCompuCellSetup.run()\n\nWait, but in CompuCell3D, the contact energies are usually set in the XML. However, if the user wants everything in Python, then accessing the plugins via simulator is necessary. Also, the cell_type creation may not be done via create_new_cell_type; maybe it's better to use the existing cell type definitions.\n\nAlternatively, the code can define the cell types using the CellTypePlugin. So perhaps in the start method:\n\ncell_type = self.cell_type_plugin.getCellTypeByName(\"CellType\")\nif cell_type is None:\n    cell_type = self.cell_type_plugin.addType(\"CellType\")\n\nBut I think the create_new_cell_type function is part of the steppable base.\n\nAlternatively, in the code, perhaps adding the cell type via the XML is needed, but the user wants the Python code. So, maybe the code defines the cell types in Python.\n\nBut perhaps the minimal code that the user expects is as follows, with required methods and basic parameters, even if the contact energy is not set. Since the user provided empty ontology annotations, maybe the code doesn't need specific cell types beyond a default. Wait, but the user said to include basic cell types based on ontology annotations. Since the annotations are empty, perhaps just a default cell type.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code includes two cell types, like 'Cell' and 'Medium', but that's standard. Let me check the example.\n\nIn CompuCell3D, the Medium is a default cell type. So creating a cell of type 'CellType' and setting contact energy between 'CellType' and 'Medium' would be standard.\n\nSo the code would:\n\n- Import necessary modules.\n\n- Define a simulation class with __init__, start, step.\n\n- In start, create a new cell type, set contact energy, create a cell.\n\n- In step, perhaps do nothing except check cells.\n\nPutting all together, here's the code:\n</think>\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom cc3d import CompuCellSetup\nfrom cc3d.core.PySteppables import *\n\nclass SimulationSteppable(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, frequency=1):\n        super().__init__(frequency)\n        \n    def start(self):\n        self.cell_type = self.create_new_cell_type(\"CellType\")\n        self.set_volume_parameters(\"CellType\", target_volume=25, lambda_volume=2.0)\n        self.set_contact_energy(\"CellType\", \"Medium\", 16)\n        cell = self.new_cell(self.cell_type)\n        self.cell_field[50,50,50] = cell\n        \n    def step(self, mcs):\n        for cell in self.cell_list:\n            if cell.volume > 25:\n                cell.targetVolume += 1\n            elif cell.volume < 25:\n                cell.targetVolume -= 1\n\nCompuCellSetup.register_steppable(SimulationSteppable(frequency=1))\nCompuCellSetup.run()\n```"

Alternatively, maybe the code defines a basic contact energy between the cell type and Medium.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user just needs the minimal code without contact energies, but the question mentions 'basic cell parameters' so volume and contact might be necessary.\n\nBut given the ontology annotations are empty, maybe just a simple setup. Let me proceed to write the code with a basic structure, initializing a cell, setting volume constraints, and contact energy between the cell type and medium.\n\nWait, but how to set contact energy in Python? Maybe through the simulator object. For example:\n\nsimulator = CompuCellSetup.simulator\nsimulator.getPotts().setCellFluctuationAmplitude(10)\ncontact_plugin = simulator.getPlugin('Contact')\ncontact_plugin.setEnergy('CellType', 'Medium', 16)\n\nBut how to include that in the code. Let me check the CompuCell3D documentation.\n\nYes, in the start method, you can access the simulator and plugins. So adding code like:\n\nsimulator = CompuCellSetup.simulator\ncontact_plugin = simulator.getPlugin('Contact')\ncontact_plugin.setEnergy('CellType', 'Medium', 16)\n\nSo integrating that into the start method.\n\nPutting it all together: The code imports CompuCellSetup and steppables. The simulation class has __init__, start, and step methods. In start, define cell types, set contact energies, create a cell. In step, adjust cell target volume or something. The XML is not part of the code, but the code is the Python part.\n\nSo the final code would look something like:\n\nimport sys\nfrom PyQt5 import QtCore, QtGui\nfrom cc3d import CompuCellSetup\nfrom cc3d.core.PySteppables import *\n\nclass SimulationSteppable(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, frequency=1):\n        super().__init__(frequency)\n\n    def start(self):\n        # Define cell types\n        self.cell_type = self.create_new_cell_type(\"CellType\")\n        # Set contact energy\n        simulator = CompuCellSetup.simulator\n        contact_plugin = simulator.getPlugin('Contact')\n        contact_plugin.setEnergy(\"CellType\", \"Medium\", 16)\n        # Create a cell\n        cell = self.new_cell(self.cell_type)\n        self.cell_field[50,50,50] = cell\n        # Set volume parameters\n        self.add_cell_type_volume_parameters(\"CellType\", target_volume=25, lambda_volume=2.0)\n\n    def step(self, mcs):\n        for cell in self.cell_list:\n            if cell.volume > 25:\n                cell.targetVolume = 25\n            else:\n                cell.targetVolume = 25\n\nCompuCellSetup.register_steppable(steppable=SimulationSteppable(frequency=1))\nCompuCellSetup.run()\n\nWait, but in CompuCell3D, the contact energies are usually set in the XML. However, if the user wants everything in Python, then accessing the plugins via simulator is necessary. Also, the cell_type creation may not be done via create_new_cell_type; maybe it's better to use the existing cell type definitions.\n\nAlternatively, the code can define the cell types using the CellTypePlugin. So perhaps in the start method:\n\ncell_type = self.cell_type_plugin.getCellTypeByName(\"CellType\")\nif cell_type is None:\n    cell_type = self.cell_type_plugin.addType(\"CellType\")\n\nBut I think the create_new_cell_type function is part of the steppable base.\n\nAlternatively, in the code, perhaps adding the cell type via the XML is needed, but the user wants the Python code. So, maybe the code defines the cell types in Python.\n\nBut perhaps the minimal code that the user expects is as follows, with required methods and basic parameters, even if the contact energy is not set. Since the user provided empty ontology annotations, maybe the code doesn't need specific cell types beyond a default. Wait, but the user said to include basic cell types based on ontology annotations. Since the annotations are empty, perhaps just a default cell type.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code includes two cell types, like 'Cell' and 'Medium', but that's standard. Let me check the example.\n\nIn CompuCell3D, the Medium is a default cell type. So creating a cell of type 'CellType' and setting contact energy between 'CellType' and 'Medium' would be standard.\n\nSo the code would:\n\n- Import necessary modules.\n\n- Define a simulation class with __init__, start, step.\n\n- In start, create a new cell type, set contact energy, create a cell.\n\n- In step, perhaps do nothing except check cells.\n\nPutting all together, here's the code:\n</think>",
