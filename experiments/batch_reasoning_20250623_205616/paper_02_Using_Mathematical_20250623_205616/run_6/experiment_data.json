      "response": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this. The user wants a JSON object with ontology annotations based on the provided biology text. The key areas are cell migration's role in physiological and pathological processes, and applications in biomedical contexts like wound healing, immune response, cancer metastasis, and artificial systems.\n\nFirst, I need to identify relevant terms for each ontology. For Cell Ontology (CellOntology), terms related to cells involved in migration. Epithelial cells (CL:0000066) are involved in processes like wound healing. Mesenchymal cells (CL:0008019) are crucial in migration during development and cancer metastasis. Immune cells like T cells (CL:0000084) participate in immune responses.\n\nNext, Gene Ontology (GeneOntology) terms. Cell migration itself (GO:0016477) is central. Related processes include wound healing (GO:0042060), immune response (GO:0006955), and cell adhesion (GO:0007155), which is important for cells moving and interacting with their environment.\n\nFor MeSH terms, \"Cell Movement\" (D002465) is the main term. Cancer metastasis (D018864) is directly mentioned. Tissue engineering (D019971) relates to artificial systems enhancing migration. Wound healing (D014947) and Neoplasm Invasiveness (D009364) are also relevant pathological processes.\n\nNeed to ensure all IDs are correctly formatted without spaces. Check each term's exact name in their respective ontologies. For example, \"Epithelial\" vs. \"epithelial cell\" \u2013 the correct term for CL is \"epithelial cell\" with ID CL:0000066. Similarly, \"cell migration\" in GO is \"Cell Migration\" with ID GO:0016477. MeSH terms should be like \"Cell Movement\" (D002465) instead of \"Cell Migration\".\n\nDouble-check each ID and term against their respective databases to avoid mistakes. Make sure the JSON structure follows the example, with categories exactly named as specified. No extra explanations, just the JSON object.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000066\",\n            \"term\": \"Epithelial Cell\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0008019\",\n            \"term\": \"Mesenchymal Cell\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000084\",\n            \"term\": \"T Cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0016477\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Migration\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0042060\",\n            \"term\": \"Wound Healing\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0006955\",\n            \"term\": \"Immune Response\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007155\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Adhesion\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002465\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Movement\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D018864\",\n            \"term\": \"Neoplasm Metastasis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D019971\",\n            \"term\": \"Tissue Engineering\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D014947\",\n            \"term\": \"Wound Healing\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D009364\",\n            \"term\": \"Neoplasm Invasiveness\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"

Let me start by recalling the structure of a typical CompuCell3D script.\n\nFirst, the necessary imports: CompuCellSetup and the steppables module. Then, a simulation class that inherits from SteppableBasePy. The class must have __init__, start, and step methods. Also, cell types and parameters based on the provided ontologies.\n\nThe CellOntology includes T Cell, Epithelial, and Mesenchymal cells. So I'll define those cell types. The GeneOntology terms suggest processes like adhesion, immune response, wound healing, and migration. MeSH terms relate to invasiveness, movement, etc. So I need to set up parameters that reflect these processes.\n\nIn the start method, I'll initialize the cell types with their respective properties. For adhesion, set the adhesion strengths between different cell types. Maybe also set target areas and lambda parameters for volume constraints.\n\nFor migration, perhaps use a chemotaxis plugin. The immune response might involve T cells moving towards some signal. Wound healing could involve epithelial cells expanding or migrating.\n\nIn the step method, implement conditions that check the simulation step. For example, after a certain step, introduce a wound by deleting some epithelial cells. Also, adjust chemotaxis parameters over time to simulate cell movement towards a chemoattractant.\n\nWait, I need to include the plugins. The adhesion requires ContactLocalProductPlugin, and chemotaxis needs ChemotaxisPlugin. Also, Volume and Surface plugins for cell volume constraints.\n\nLet me structure the code step by step. Start with imports, then create the simulation class. In __init__, register the appropriate plugins. In start, set up cell types, adhesion strengths, volume parameters, and chemotaxis. In step, handle the wound creation and maybe update chemotaxis.\n\nI should make sure to set the correct adhesion values. Epithelial cells might adhere more strongly to each other, while mesenchymal cells have lower adhesion, promoting migration. T cells might have moderate adhesion.\n\nFor chemotaxis, assign a chemical field, maybe a gradient that mesenchymal cells follow. Also, T cells could be attracted to some immune signal.\n\nTesting if all required elements are included: cell types, adhesion, volume, chemotaxis, and a wound healing scenario.
