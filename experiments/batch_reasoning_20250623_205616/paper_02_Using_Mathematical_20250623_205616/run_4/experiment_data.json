      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me start by parsing the user's request. They want structured ontology annotations based on the provided chapter description. The key ontologies are CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH, each with specific formatting rules.\n\nFirst, I'll look for terms related to Cell Ontology. The text mentions cell migration, which is a process. But Cell Ontology (CL) typically deals with cell types. The examples given in the original text include physiological processes like wound healing and immune response, which might involve specific cell types. For instance, epithelial cells and mesenchymal cells are often involved in processes like metastasis. So I should check CL for those. Epithelial cells are CL:0000066 and mesenchymal stem cells are CL:0000134. Are there other relevant cell types? Maybe immune cells like T cells (CL:0000084) since the immune response is mentioned.\n\nNext, Gene Ontology (GO) terms. The main process here is cell migration (GO:0016477). Other related terms could be cell proliferation (GO:0008283) since anti-cancer treatments target that, and maybe cell adhesion (GO:0007155) because it's related to migration. Also, wound healing involves cell migration, so perhaps that's covered under the same GO term.\n\nFor MeSH terms, the chapter discusses biomedical topics like cell migration (MeSH D002465), neoplasms metastasis (MeSH D009362), wound healing (MeSH D014947), and immune system processes (MeSH D007107). Anti-cancer treatments could relate to antineoplastic agents (MeSH D000970), but the text specifically mentions blocking cell migration, so maybe focusing on metastasis and cell movement terms is better.\n\nI need to ensure all IDs are correctly formatted without spaces. Also, term names must be exact. For example, \"Epithelial\" not \"Epithelial Cell\" if the CL term uses just \"Epithelial\". Wait, checking the actual CL terms: CL:0000066 is \"epithelial cell\", so the term should be \"Epithelial Cell\". Similarly, CL:0000134 is \"mesenchymal stem cell\". But the user example used \"Epithelial\" without \"Cell\". Wait, the example in the system message shows \"Epithelial\" as the term for CL:0000000. However, the actual correct term for CL:0000066 is \"epithelial cell\". Should I use the exact term name as per the ontology, even if it includes \"cell\"? Because the user emphasized term names must be exact. So for CL:0000066, the term is \"epithelial cell\", so I should write \"Epithelial Cell\" with proper capitalization? Wait, the example in the system message has \"Epithelial\" as the term, but maybe the actual terms in CL have different capitalization. Need to check. However, according to CL, terms are usually in lowercase except proper nouns, but in the example, the user used title case. The user's example shows \"Epithelial\" as the term, but actual CL terms are \"epithelial cell\". Hmm, conflicting info. The user's instructions say term names must be exact without extra spaces. So I should use the exact term as it appears in the ontology. For example, CL:0000066 is \"epithelial cell\", so the term should be \"epithelial cell\" in lowercase. But the example in the system message shows \"Epithelial\" with a capital E. Wait, the user's example isn't necessarily accurate to real terms. The user might have simplified it. But the actual correct approach is to use the exact term name as per the ontology. However, the user's example shows \"Epithelial\" as the term. This is a conflict. The user's instruction says: \"Term names must be exact without extra spaces\". So I should use the exact term from the ontology. For example, if the CL term is \"epithelial cell\", then the term should be written as \"epithelial cell\". But maybe the user expects the term to be capitalized as in their example. Wait, the user's example uses \"Epithelial\" but that's not the real term. Maybe the user simplified it. This is a problem. How to resolve?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is more concerned about the formatting (exact, no extra spaces) rather than the exact case. But the example shows \"Epithelial\" capitalized. However, in reality, CL terms are in lowercase except proper nouns. For example, CL:0000066 is \"epithelial cell\". So the correct term would be \"epithelial cell\". But the user's example shows \"Epithelial\" (singular, capitalized). That's a discrepancy. Since the user provided an example with \"Epithelial\" as the term, maybe they expect us to follow that format, even if it's not exactly matching the real ontology. But that's risky. Alternatively, perhaps the user is unaware of the exact terms and just wants the closest match. Hmm. This is a challenge.\n\nSame with mesenchymal. The term in CL is \"mesenchymal cell\" or \"mesenchymal stem cell\". CL:0000134 is \"mesenchymal stem cell\". So the term should be \"mesenchymal stem cell\". But in the user's example, they have \"Mesenchymal\". So again, there's a conflict between the example and the actual ontology terms.\n\nGiven the user's strict instructions to format term names exactly as specified, but without extra spaces, perhaps the correct approach is to use the exact term names from the ontologies, even if they differ from the example. Because the user might have provided an example with simplified terms, but in reality, the correct terms should be used. For instance, \"epithelial cell\" instead of \"Epithelial\".\n\nBut how to verify? Since I can't look up the exact terms right now, but based on common knowledge, CL terms typically include \"cell\" in their names. So for epithelial cells, CL:0000066 is \"epithelial cell\". Similarly, mesenchymal stem cells are CL:0000134. Immune response cells like T cells are CL:0000084 \"T cell\".\n\nSo, for CellOntology, possible entries:\n\n- CL:0000066, epithelial cell\n- CL:0000134, mesenchymal stem cell\n- CL:0000084, T cell (if immune response is considered)\n\nBut the original text mentions immune response, which involves T cells. Also, wound healing involves epithelial cells. Metastasis involves epithelial-mesenchymal transition, so mesenchymal cells. So those three cell types are relevant.\n\nFor GeneOntology, cell migration is GO:0016477. Cell proliferation is GO:0008283. Wound healing is GO:0042060. Immune response is GO:0006955. Cell adhesion is GO:0007155. But the text specifically mentions cell migration as the example, so that's a key term. Also, blocking cell migration for anti-cancer treatment, so maybe cell migration is the primary GO term.\n\nFor MeSH terms, cell migration is D002465. Neoplasm metastasis is D009362. Wound healing is D014947. Immune system processes could be D007107. Chronic inflammation is D007249. Anti-cancer treatments might involve D000970 (Antineoplastic Agents), but the text mentions blocking cell migration, so perhaps D002465 (Cell Movement) is already covered. Also, tissue invasion could relate to Neoplasm Invasiveness (D009364).\n\nPutting this together, the JSON should have:\n\nCellOntology:\n- CL:0000066, epithelial cell\n- CL:0000134, mesenchymal stem cell\n- CL:0000084, T cell\n\nGeneOntology:\n- GO:0016477, cell migration\n- GO:0008283, cell proliferation\n- GO:0042060, wound healing\n- GO:0006955, immune response\n\nMeSH:\n- D002465, Cell Movement\n- D009362, Neoplasm Metastasis\n- D014947, Wound Healing\n- D007107, Immunity\n- D007249, Inflammation\n\nBut need to check exact MeSH terms. For example, \"Cell Movement\" is D002465. \"Neoplasm Metastasis\" is D009362. \"Wound Healing\" is D014947. \"Immune System\" is D007107. \"Inflammation\" is D007249.\n\nSo, compiling all these into the JSON structure with exact IDs and terms as per the ontologies.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000066\",\n            \"term\": \"epithelial cell\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000134\",\n            \"term\": \"mesenchymal stem cell\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000084\",\n            \"term\": \"T cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0016477\",\n            \"term\": \"cell migration\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0008283\",\n            \"term\": \"cell proliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0042060\",\n            \"term\": \"wound healing\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0006955\",\n            \"term\": \"immune response\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002465\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Movement\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D009362\",\n            \"term\": \"Neoplasm Metastasis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D014947\",\n            \"term\": \"W"
