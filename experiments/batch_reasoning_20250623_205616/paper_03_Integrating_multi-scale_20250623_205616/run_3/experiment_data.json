      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to tackle this. The user wants ontology annotations based on the provided text. The main categories are CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH. Each needs specific IDs and terms without any extra spaces or formatting issues.\n\nFirst, I'll look for cell types mentioned. The text talks about endocardial and myocardial cells. So CellOntology entries should be CL terms for those. Let me check the correct CL IDs. Endocardial cells are CL:0002250, and myocardial cells are CL:0000746. Got it.\n\nNext, GeneOntology terms. The processes mentioned include cell-cell interaction, cell behavior, heart development, and systems biology. For cell-cell interaction, GO:0007156 is cell-cell adhesion. Tissue-specific cell behavior might be GO:0003007 (heart morphogenesis) and GO:0048863 (cellular extravasation). Systems biology could be GO:0065007 (biological regulation). Wait, maybe heart development is better as GO:0007507. Let me confirm. Yes, GO:0007507 is heart development. \n\nFor MeSH terms, the topics are heart development, mathematical models, and biological models. MeSH D006332 is Heart, but maybe there's a more specific term for development. D006332 is Heart, D009123 is Models, Biological, and D008664 is Models, Theoretical. That fits.\n\nI need to make sure all IDs are correctly formatted without spaces. Terms should be exact, like \"Endocardial Cell\" and \"Myocardial Cell\" for CellOntology. GeneOntology terms should match the exact GO terms, like \"Cell-Cell Adhesion\" and \"Heart Development\". MeSH terms are \"Heart\", \"Models, Biological\", and \"Models, Theoretical\".\n\nDouble-checking each ID and term. No extra spaces, correct capitalization. Let's put it all together into the JSON structure as specified. Make sure each ontology category has the right array of objects. No explanations, just the JSON.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0002250\",\n            \"term\": \"Endocardial Cell\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000746\",\n            \"term\": \"Myocardial Cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007156\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell-Cell Adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0003007\",\n            \"term\": \"Heart Morphogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0048863\",\n            \"term\": \"Cellular Extravasation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007507\",\n            \"term\": \"Heart Development\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D006332\",\n            \"term\": \"Heart\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D009123\",\n            \"term\": \"Models, Biological\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D008664\",\n            \"term\": \"Models, Theoretical\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"

The user wants Python code that includes necessary imports, a simulation class inheriting from SteppableBasePy, and the required methods: __init__, start, and step. Also, the code must incorporate the specified cell types and parameters from the ontology.\n\nFirst, the imports. CompuCellSetup and steppables are required. So I'll import those. Also, I might need to import modules like CompuCell and sys, which are common in CC3D scripts.\n\nNext, the simulation class. It should inherit from steppables.SteppableBasePy. The class needs an __init__ method that calls the parent's __init__. The start method initializes the simulation, sets up cells, and the step method defines actions each simulation step.\n\nLooking at the CellOntology, there are two cell types: Myocardial and Endocardial. I'll define these in the start method using self.cellType. The GeneOntology terms suggest processes like heart development, morphogenesis, cell adhesion, and extravasation. So I need to include parameters related to adhesion and maybe cell movement. The MeSH terms indicate biological and theoretical models, so ensuring the simulation is set up as a biological model is important.\n\nIn the start method, I'll create a cell field and maybe initialize some cells. For cell adhesion, setting the contact energy between cell types is necessary. Myocardial cells should have higher adhesion with each other, lower with Endocardial, and both have higher adhesion with the medium compared to other interactions.\n\nThe step method might handle cellular behaviors each timestep. Since Cellular Extravasation is mentioned, maybe some cells migrate or change types, but since specifics aren't given, I'll keep it simple for now\u2014just incrementing a target volume to simulate growth.\n\nI should also set up the simulation parameters in the start method, like cell volumes and adhesion energies.
