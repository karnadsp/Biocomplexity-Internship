      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants structured ontology annotations based on the provided biological description. They specified using CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH terms. I need to make sure the categories are named exactly as given, without any extra spaces or variations.\n\nFirst, I'll look for cell types mentioned. The text talks about endocardial and myocardial cells. Checking Cell Ontology, \"endocardial cell\" is CL:0002250 and \"myocardial cell\" is CL:0000746. So those should go under CellOntology.\n\nNext, Gene Ontology terms. The process involves cell-cell interactions, which would be GO:0007156. Cell proliferation is mentioned, so GO:0008283. Also, there's mention of molecular pathways, maybe signaling pathways like GO:0007165. Tissue development might be GO:0009888. Morphogenesis of the heart is GO:0003007. Those are possible GO terms.\n\nFor MeSH, the main topics are heart development, so \"Heart\" D006331. Systems biology is D000069043. Cell movement could be D002465. Models, Biological is D008954. Computational biology is D019296. Molecular pathways might be D008958 (but I need to verify if that's the exact term). Tissue-specific behavior could be under \"Cell Differentiation\" D002454 or similar.\n\nI need to ensure all IDs are correctly formatted without spaces. Check each term's exact name in their respective ontologies. For example, \"Cell-Cell Signaling\" vs. \"Cell-cell signaling\" \u2013 GO uses the former with hyphen and capitalization. MeSH terms should match exactly, like \"Systems Biology\" versus \"Systems biology\".\n\nWait, the example given uses \"Cell Division\" with a space. So terms should have exact names. Let me confirm:\n\n- Cell Ontology terms: \"endocardial cell\" and \"myocardial cell\" are correct.\n- Gene Ontology: \"Cell-Cell Signaling\" (GO:0007156), \"Cell Proliferation\" (GO:0008283), \"Signal Transduction\" (GO:0007165), \"Tissue Development\" (GO:0009888), \"Heart Morphogenesis\" (GO:0003007).\n- MeSH: \"Heart\" (D006331), \"Systems Biology\" (D000069043), \"Cell Movement\" (D002465), \"Models, Biological\" (D008954), \"Computational Biology\" (D019296), \"Molecular Pathways\" (D008958).\n\nWait, MeSH term for Molecular Pathways might be \"Signal Transduction\" (D015398) instead. But the text mentions molecular pathways underlying interactions. Alternatively, \"Molecular Biology\" is D008958. Hmm, maybe \"Signal Transduction\" is more appropriate. But the user mentioned \"molecular pathways\", so perhaps D008958 (Molecular Biology) isn't right. Maybe \"Signal Transduction\" D015398? Or is there a MeSH term for \"Molecular Pathways\"? Let me check.\n\nLooking up MeSH, \"Signal Transduction\" is D015398, and \"Molecular Biology\" is D008958. The term \"Molecular Pathways\" isn't a MeSH term. The text says \"molecular pathways underlying cell\u2013cell interactions\", so \"Signal Transduction\" might be better. Alternatively, maybe \"Biological Processes\" (D001690) but that's too general. Since the user wants exact terms, perhaps it's better to omit that one if unsure. But the example includes \"Cell Proliferation\" which is a MeSH term. Let me check MeSH for \"Cell Proliferation\" \u2013 yes, D002466. But in the example, they used \"Cell Proliferation\" under MeSH. Wait, but in the user's example, the MeSH term was \"Cell Proliferation\" with id D000000 (example), but actual MeSH for Cell Proliferation is D002466. However, in the given text, the MeSH terms would be related to the context. The original text mentions systems biology, computational models, heart development, etc.\n\nSo for MeSH terms:\n\n- Heart: D006331\n- Systems Biology: D000069043\n- Cell Movement: D002465 (since trabeculation involves cell behavior)\n- Models, Biological: D008954 (as they used computational models)\n- Computational Biology: D019296\n- Molecular Pathways: Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, \"Cell Communication\" D002470. But the user might not expect that. Alternatively, perhaps \"Signal Transduction\" D015398. But I need to verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Models, Biological\" is sufficient. Let's proceed with the ones that are clearly matching.\n\nSo compiling the JSON:\n\nCellOntology entries: endocardial cell (CL:0002250) and myocardial cell (CL:0000746).\n\nGeneOntology entries: Cell-Cell Signaling (GO:0007156), Cell Proliferation (GO:0008283), Signal Transduction (GO:0007165), Tissue Development (GO:0009888), Heart Morphogenesis (GO:0003007).\n\nMeSH entries: Heart (D006331), Systems Biology (D000069043), Cell Movement (D002465), Models, Biological (D008954), Computational Biology (D019296).\n\nDouble-checking the MeSH terms:\n\n- \"Systems Biology\" is D000069043.\n- \"Cell Movement\" is D002465.\n- \"Models, Biological\" is D008954.\n- \"Computational Biology\" is D019296.\n- \"Heart\" is D006331.\n\nThat should cover the main aspects mentioned: heart development, systems biology approach, computational models, cell movement (as part of trabeculation), etc.\n\nSo the final JSON would structure these under the correct categories with exact IDs and terms.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0002250\",\n            \"term\": \"endocardial cell\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000746\",\n            \"term\": \"myocardial cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007156\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell-Cell Signaling\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0008283\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Proliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007165\",\n            \"term\": \"Signal Transduction\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0009888\",\n            \"term\": \"Tissue Development\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0003007\",\n            \"term\": \"Heart Morphogenesis\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D006331\",\n            \"term\": \"Heart\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D000069043\",\n            \"term\": \"Systems Biology\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002465\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Movement\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D008954\",\n            \"term\": \"Models, Biological\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D019296\",\n            \"term\": \"Computational Biology\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a CompuCell3D simulation Python file based on the given ontology annotations. Let me start by recalling the structure of a typical CompuCell3D script.\n\nFirst, the necessary imports. CompuCellSetup is always needed, and steppables for the simulation classes. So I'll import those.\n\nNext, the simulation class must inherit from SteppableBasePy. The user specified required methods: __init__, start, and step. In the __init__ method, I should call the parent class's __init__.\n\nThe ontology annotations include two cell types: endocardial and myocardial cells. I need to define these in the start method using self.cellTypeDict. Assigning their types with appropriate names and setting colors for visualization.\n\nFor parameters based on the GeneOntology terms like Signal Transduction, Tissue Development, etc., I should incorporate elements that reflect these processes. Maybe include chemotaxis for cell movement (MeSH Cell Movement), proliferation parameters, and some signaling fields.\n\nAdding a chemical field for signaling, maybe a concentration field. In the step method, handle cell behaviors. For cell proliferation (GO:0008283), check if a cell's volume is above a threshold and then divide. For chemotaxis (related to Cell Movement), set a lambda parameter and assign a chemical field to influence direction.\n\nAlso, considering Heart Morphogenesis and Tissue Development, perhaps set adhesion parameters between the cell types to influence how they arrange. Myocardial cells might have higher adhesion to stick together.\n\nNeed to set the simulation dimensions using CompuCellSetup.registerSimulation. And make sure to include the steppable in the registrations.\n\nWait, the user mentioned the simulation class should have start and step methods. In the start method, initialize the cell types. In step, handle the behaviors each time step.\n\nChecking for cell division: in the step method, loop through each cell, check volume, and call divide if necessary.\n\nFor chemotaxis, maybe use the FlexibleDiffusionSolverFE for the chemical field. But since the user didn't ask for the PDE solver, maybe just define the field and let the steppable handle chemotaxis via the plugin.\n\nWait, in CompuCell3D, chemotaxis is typically handled through plugins. So I need to import the Chemotaxis plugin and configure it. But the user wants only the Python code, so perhaps in the start method, add the chemotaxis parameters to the cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set the lambda and chemical field in the start method using the steppable's API.\n\nHmm. To keep it basic, perhaps use the VolumeLocalFlex plugin for growth and the Chemotaxis plugin. But the code needs to include the necessary setup.\n\nAlternatively, since the code must be self-contained, perhaps include the necessary XML setup via the Python script. Wait, but the user wants the Python code. CompuCell3D often uses XML with Python. But the question says to generate the Python code, so maybe the user expects the Python part without XML. However, sometimes in CompuCell, you have to set up plugins via Python.\n\nWait, the standard approach is to have a separate XML file, but the user wants the Python code. So perhaps the code includes the necessary plugin registrations via Python.\n\nWait, but in the code provided by the user example, maybe they just include the Python part, assuming that the XML is handled elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe use the Simulation class in Python to set parameters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user expects a minimal Python script that defines the simulation, cell types, and basic behaviors without detailed plugins, relying on default settings.\n\nIn the given ontology, Cell-Cell Signaling (GO:0007156) and Signal Transduction (GO:0007165) could be represented by a chemical field that cells respond to. So adding a chemical field named 'Signal' and configuring chemotaxis towards it.\n\nFor Cell Proliferation (GO:0008283), cells grow and divide when they reach a certain volume. So in the step method, check cell.volume and divide if it's above a threshold.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nImports: CompuCellSetup, steppables, cc3d.CompuCell (for Cell), and perhaps the chemotaxis module.\n\nSimulation class inherits from SteppableBasePy. In __init__, call parent __init__.\n\nIn start method: define cell types, set adhesion parameters, set up the chemical field, configure chemotaxis parameters for each cell type.\n\nIn step method: handle cell proliferation by checking volume and dividing, and maybe update the chemical field (but without a solver, maybe skip that for simplicity).\n\nWait, but the chemical field needs a solver. So perhaps include a diffusion solver. But in the code, maybe add the solver setup via XML elements in the Python script. However, the user wants only the Python code. So perhaps use the core CompuCellSetup functions to add the solver.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user just wants the basic structure without the full solver setup, but that might not be valid. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the Secretion plugin to handle the chemical field. But this is getting complicated. Since the user specified to return only the Python code, perhaps include the necessary parts in Python even if they reference plugins.\n\nBut perhaps in the start method, after defining cell types, configure the chemical field and chemotaxis parameters.\n\nWait, here's a possible approach:\n\nDefine the chemical field using self.addSecretedField('Signal').\n\nThen, in the start method, assign chemotaxis parameters to each cell type using the Chemotaxis plugin.\n\nBut how to access the plugin via Python? Maybe through the steppable's API.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code would look like this:\n\nIn the start method:\n\nfor cell in self.cell_list:\n    if cell.type == self.ENDOCARDIAL:\n        cell.lambdaChemotaxis = 100.0\n        cell.chemotactTowardsField('Signal', 1.0)\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact syntax. Alternatively, using the ChemotaxisData from cc3d.cpp.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should use the plugin API.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal code would set up the fields and cell behaviors without explicit solver setup, assuming that the XML config handles that. But the user wants the code to be valid, so perhaps the code should include all necessary parts.\n\nBut given time constraints, perhaps proceed with a basic structure that includes cell types, adhesion, a chemical field, chemotaxis parameters, and cell division.\n\nSo here's the code outline:\n\nImports:\nfrom cc3d import CompuCellSetup\nfrom cc3d.core.PySteppables import *\n\nSimulation class:\n\nclass MySimulation(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, frequency=1):\n        super().__init__(frequency)\n        # Initialization code if needed\n\n    def start(self):\n        # Define cell types\n        self.endocardial = self.new_cell_type(\"Endocardial\", \"FF0000\")\n        self.myocardial = self.new_cell_type(\"Myocardial\", \"00FF00\")\n        \n        # Set adhesion parameters\n        self.cell_type_contact_energy[self.endocardial][self.endocardial] = 10\n        self.cell_type_contact_energy[self.myocardial][self.myocardial] = 5\n        self.cell_type_contact_energy[self.endocardial][self.myocardial] = 20\n        \n        # Setup chemical field\n        self.add_chemical_field(\"Signal\")\n        \n        # Configure chemotaxis\n        for cell in self.cell_list:\n            if cell.type == self.endocardial:\n                cell.lambda_chemotaxis = 2.0\n                cell.chemotact_towards(self.get_field(\"Signal\"), 1.0)\n            elif cell.type == self.myocardial:\n                cell.lambda_chemotaxis = 1.0\n                cell.chemotact_towards(self.get_field(\"Signal\"), -0.5)\n        \n    def step(self, mcs):\n        # Cell proliferation\n        for cell in self.cell_list:\n            if cell.volume > 50:\n                cell.target_volume = 25\n                self.divide_cell_random_orientation(cell)\n\nCompuCellSetup.register_steppable(steppable=MySimulation(frequency=1))\n\nWait, but in the current API, some method names might differ. For example, adding a chemical field might require using the Secretion plugin or a diffusion solver. Also, contact energies are set via the Contact plugin.\n\nIn CompuCell3D's Python API, to set contact energy, you can use:\n\nself.cell_type_contact_energy[type1][type2] = energy\n\nBut first, the cell types need to be defined.\n\nWait, in the start method, you can create the cell types using:\n\nself.endocardial = self.new_cell_type(\"Endocardial\")\n\nThen, setting contact energy:\n\nself.cell_type_contact_energy[self.endocardial][self.endocardial] = 10\n\nBut I need to check the exact syntax. Also, for the chemical field, perhaps using:\n\nfield = self.create_field(\"ChemicalField\", \"Signal\")\n\nBut maybe it's better to use the add_secreted_field method or similar.\n\nAlternatively, if the field is part of the PDE solver, then we need to configure that. But since the user's code must be valid, perhaps the code should include the necessary steps to set up the solver.\n\nBut this is getting complex. Perhaps the code should focus on the cell behaviors and basic setup, assuming"

Alternatively, maybe \"Biological Processes\" (D001690) but that's too general. Since the user wants exact terms, perhaps it's better to omit that one if unsure. But the example includes \"Cell Proliferation\" which is a MeSH term. Let me check MeSH for \"Cell Proliferation\" \u2013 yes, D002466. But in the example, they used \"Cell Proliferation\" under MeSH. Wait, but in the user's example, the MeSH term was \"Cell Proliferation\" with id D000000 (example), but actual MeSH for Cell Proliferation is D002466. However, in the given text, the MeSH terms would be related to the context. The original text mentions systems biology, computational models, heart development, etc.\n\nSo for MeSH terms:\n\n- Heart: D006331\n- Systems Biology: D000069043\n- Cell Movement: D002465 (since trabeculation involves cell behavior)\n- Models, Biological: D008954 (as they used computational models)\n- Computational Biology: D019296\n- Molecular Pathways: Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, \"Cell Communication\" D002470. But the user might not expect that. Alternatively, perhaps \"Signal Transduction\" D015398. But I need to verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Models, Biological\" is sufficient. Let's proceed with the ones that are clearly matching.\n\nSo compiling the JSON:\n\nCellOntology entries: endocardial cell (CL:0002250) and myocardial cell (CL:0000746).\n\nGeneOntology entries: Cell-Cell Signaling (GO:0007156), Cell Proliferation (GO:0008283), Signal Transduction (GO:0007165), Tissue Development (GO:0009888), Heart Morphogenesis (GO:0003007).\n\nMeSH entries: Heart (D006331), Systems Biology (D000069043), Cell Movement (D002465), Models, Biological (D008954), Computational Biology (D019296).\n\nDouble-checking the MeSH terms:\n\n- \"Systems Biology\" is D000069043.\n- \"Cell Movement\" is D002465.\n- \"Models, Biological\" is D008954.\n- \"Computational Biology\" is D019296.\n- \"Heart\" is D006331.\n\nThat should cover the main aspects mentioned: heart development, systems biology approach, computational models, cell movement (as part of trabeculation), etc.\n\nSo the final JSON would structure these under the correct categories with exact IDs and terms.\n</think>",

      "python_code": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a CompuCell3D simulation Python file based on the given ontology annotations. Let me start by recalling the structure of a typical CompuCell3D script.\n\nFirst, the necessary imports. CompuCellSetup is always needed, and steppables for the simulation classes. So I'll import those.\n\nNext, the simulation class must inherit from SteppableBasePy. The user specified required methods: __init__, start, and step. In the __init__ method, I should call the parent class's __init__.\n\nThe ontology annotations include two cell types: endocardial and myocardial cells. I need to define these in the start method using self.cellTypeDict. Assigning their types with appropriate names and setting colors for visualization.\n\nFor parameters based on the GeneOntology terms like Signal Transduction, Tissue Development, etc., I should incorporate elements that reflect these processes. Maybe include chemotaxis for cell movement (MeSH Cell Movement), proliferation parameters, and some signaling fields.\n\nAdding a chemical field for signaling, maybe a concentration field. In the step method, handle cell behaviors. For cell proliferation (GO:0008283), check if a cell's volume is above a threshold and then divide. For chemotaxis (related to Cell Movement), set a lambda parameter and assign a chemical field to influence direction.\n\nAlso, considering Heart Morphogenesis and Tissue Development, perhaps set adhesion parameters between the cell types to influence how they arrange. Myocardial cells might have higher adhesion to stick together.\n\nNeed to set the simulation dimensions using CompuCellSetup.registerSimulation. And make sure to include the steppable in the registrations.\n\nWait, the user mentioned the simulation class should have start and step methods. In the start method, initialize the cell types. In step, handle the behaviors each time step.\n\nChecking for cell division: in the step method, loop through each cell, check volume, and call divide if necessary.\n\nFor chemotaxis, maybe use the FlexibleDiffusionSolverFE for the chemical field. But since the user didn't ask for the PDE solver, maybe just define the field and let the steppable handle chemotaxis via the plugin.\n\nWait, in CompuCell3D, chemotaxis is typically handled through plugins. So I need to import the Chemotaxis plugin and configure it. But the user wants only the Python code, so perhaps in the start method, add the chemotaxis parameters to the cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set the lambda and chemical field in the start method using the steppable's API.\n\nHmm. To keep it basic, perhaps use the VolumeLocalFlex plugin for growth and the Chemotaxis plugin. But the code needs to include the necessary setup.\n\nAlternatively, since the code must be self-contained, perhaps include the necessary XML setup via the Python script. Wait, but the user wants the Python code. CompuCell3D often uses XML with Python. But the question says to generate the Python code, so maybe the user expects the Python part without XML. However, sometimes in CompuCell, you have to set up plugins via Python.\n\nWait, the standard approach is to have a separate XML file, but the user wants the Python code. So perhaps the code includes the necessary plugin registrations via Python.\n\nWait, but in the code provided by the user example, maybe they just include the Python part, assuming that the XML is handled elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe use the Simulation class in Python to set parameters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user expects a minimal Python script that defines the simulation, cell types, and basic behaviors without detailed plugins, relying on default settings.\n\nIn the given ontology, Cell-Cell Signaling (GO:0007156) and Signal Transduction (GO:0007165) could be represented by a chemical field that cells respond to. So adding a chemical field named 'Signal' and configuring chemotaxis towards it.\n\nFor Cell Proliferation (GO:0008283), cells grow and divide when they reach a certain volume. So in the step method, check cell.volume and divide if it's above a threshold.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nImports: CompuCellSetup, steppables, cc3d.CompuCell (for Cell), and perhaps the chemotaxis module.\n\nSimulation class inherits from SteppableBasePy. In __init__, call parent __init__.\n\nIn start method: define cell types, set adhesion parameters, set up the chemical field, configure chemotaxis parameters for each cell type.\n\nIn step method: handle cell proliferation by checking volume and dividing, and maybe update the chemical field (but without a solver, maybe skip that for simplicity).\n\nWait, but the chemical field needs a solver. So perhaps include a diffusion solver. But in the code, maybe add the solver setup via XML elements in the Python script. However, the user wants only the Python code. So perhaps use the core CompuCellSetup functions to add the solver.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user just wants the basic structure without the full solver setup, but that might not be valid. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the Secretion plugin to handle the chemical field. But this is getting complicated. Since the user specified to return only the Python code, perhaps include the necessary parts in Python even if they reference plugins.\n\nBut perhaps in the start method, after defining cell types, configure the chemical field and chemotaxis parameters.\n\nWait, here's a possible approach:\n\nDefine the chemical field using self.addSecretedField('Signal').\n\nThen, in the start method, assign chemotaxis parameters to each cell type using the Chemotaxis plugin.\n\nBut how to access the plugin via Python? Maybe through the steppable's API.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code would look like this:\n\nIn the start method:\n\nfor cell in self.cell_list:\n    if cell.type == self.ENDOCARDIAL:\n        cell.lambdaChemotaxis = 100.0\n        cell.chemotactTowardsField('Signal', 1.0)\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact syntax. Alternatively, using the ChemotaxisData from cc3d.cpp.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should use the plugin API.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal code would set up the fields and cell behaviors without explicit solver setup, assuming that the XML config handles that. But the user wants the code to be valid, so perhaps the code should include all necessary parts.\n\nBut given time constraints, perhaps proceed with a basic structure that includes cell types, adhesion, a chemical field, chemotaxis parameters, and cell division.\n\nSo here's the code outline:\n\nImports:\nfrom cc3d import CompuCellSetup\nfrom cc3d.core.PySteppables import *\n\nSimulation class:\n\nclass MySimulation(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, frequency=1):\n        super().__init__(frequency)\n        # Initialization code if needed\n\n    def start(self):\n        # Define cell types\n        self.endocardial = self.new_cell_type(\"Endocardial\", \"FF0000\")\n        self.myocardial = self.new_cell_type(\"Myocardial\", \"00FF00\")\n        \n        # Set adhesion parameters\n        self.cell_type_contact_energy[self.endocardial][self.endocardial] = 10\n        self.cell_type_contact_energy[self.myocardial][self.myocardial] = 5\n        self.cell_type_contact_energy[self.endocardial][self.myocardial] = 20\n        \n        # Setup chemical field\n        self.add_chemical_field(\"Signal\")\n        \n        # Configure chemotaxis\n        for cell in self.cell_list:\n            if cell.type == self.endocardial:\n                cell.lambda_chemotaxis = 2.0\n                cell.chemotact_towards(self.get_field(\"Signal\"), 1.0)\n            elif cell.type == self.myocardial:\n                cell.lambda_chemotaxis = 1.0\n                cell.chemotact_towards(self.get_field(\"Signal\"), -0.5)\n        \n    def step(self, mcs):\n        # Cell proliferation\n        for cell in self.cell_list:\n            if cell.volume > 50:\n                cell.target_volume = 25\n                self.divide_cell_random_orientation(cell)\n\nCompuCellSetup.register_steppable(steppable=MySimulation(frequency=1))\n\nWait, but in the current API, some method names might differ. For example, adding a chemical field might require using the Secretion plugin or a diffusion solver. Also, contact energies are set via the Contact plugin.\n\nIn CompuCell3D's Python API, to set contact energy, you can use:\n\nself.cell_type_contact_energy[type1][type2] = energy\n\nBut first, the cell types need to be defined.\n\nWait, in the start method, you can create the cell types using:\n\nself.endocardial = self.new_cell_type(\"Endocardial\")\n\nThen, setting contact energy:\n\nself.cell_type_contact_energy[self.endocardial][self.endocardial] = 10\n\nBut I need to check the exact syntax. Also, for the chemical field, perhaps using:\n\nfield = self.create_field(\"ChemicalField\", \"Signal\")\n\nBut maybe it's better to use the add_secreted_field method or similar.\n\nAlternatively, if the field is part of the PDE solver, then we need to configure that. But since the user's code must be valid, perhaps the code should include the necessary steps to set up the solver.\n\nBut this is getting complex. Perhaps the code should focus on the cell behaviors and basic setup, assuming",
