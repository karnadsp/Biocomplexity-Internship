    "response": "Here are specific clarification questions to help identify relevant Cell Ontology (CL), Gene Ontology (GO), and MeSH terms for this system:  \n\n### **Cell Ontology (CL) Questions:**  \n1. What specific type of epithelial tissue is present (e.g., simple squamous, stratified columnar, pseudostratified)?  \n2. Are the fibroblasts a distinct layer or intermingled with the epithelial cells?  \n3. Does the epithelial tissue have any specialized features (e.g., cilia, microvilli, tight junctions)?  \n4. Is this structure part of a known organ system (e.g., respiratory, digestive, vascular)?  \n5. Are there any other cell types present (e.g., immune cells, endothelial cells, smooth muscle)?  \n\n### **Gene Ontology (GO) Questions:**  \n6. What biological processes are relevant (e.g., epithelial barrier maintenance, lumen formation, extracellular matrix organization)?  \n7. Are there specific molecular functions involved (e.g., cell adhesion, ion transport, secretion)?  \n8. Are there known signaling pathways active in this system (e.g., Wnt, TGF-\u03b2, Notch)?  \n9. Does the system involve developmental processes (e.g., tube formation, epithelial-mesenchymal interactions)?  \n\n### **MeSH Terms Questions:**  \n10. Is this structure part of a specific anatomical region (e.g., trachea, intestine, blood vessel)?  \n11. Are there disease associations (e.g., fibrosis, epithelial dysplasia, stenosis)?  \n12. Are there experimental techniques used to study this system (e.g., organoid culture, histology, 3D imaging)?  \n13. Are there known extracellular matrix components (e.g., collagen, fibronectin, laminin)?  \n\nThese questions will help refine ontology term selection for accurate modeling. Would additional context on species or developmental stage be useful?"
