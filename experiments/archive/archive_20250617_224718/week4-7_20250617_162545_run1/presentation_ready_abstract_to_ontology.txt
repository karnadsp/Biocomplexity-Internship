Initial Description:
- E3 ubiquitin ligases are important cellular components that determine the specificity of proteolysis in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. However, an increasing number of studies have indicated that E3 ubiquitin ligases also participate in transcription. Intrigued by the apparently paradoxical functions of E3 ubiquitin ligases in both proteolysis and transcriptional activation, we investigated the underlying design principles using mathematical modeling. We found that the antagonistic functions integrated in E3 ubiquitin ligases can prevent any undesirable sustained activation of downstream genes when E3 ubiquitin ligases are destabilized by unexpected perturbations. Interestingly, this design principle of the system is similar to the operational principle of a safety interlock device in engineering systems, which prevents a system from abnormal operation unless stability is guaranteed.

Ontology Annotations:
<think>


Okay
,
 I
 need
 to
 create
 a
 structured
 ontology
 annotation
 based
 on
 the
 provided
 information
 about
 E
3
 ubiqu
itin
 lig
ases
.
 The
 user
 wants
 this
 in
 JSON
 format
,
 categor
izing
 different
 ontology
 types
 like
 Cell
 Ont
ology
,
 GO
,
 and
 Me
SH
.
 


First
,
 I
'll
 read
 through
 the
 original
 description
 to
 understand
 the
 key
 points
.
 E
3
 ubiqu
itin
 lig
ases
 are
 involved
 in
 prote
ol
ysis
 via
 the
 ubiqu
itin
-pro
te
as
ome
 system
 and
 also
 play
 a
 role
 in
 transcription
.
 The
 study
 uses
 mathematical
 modeling
 to
 explore
 how
 these
 lig
ases
 balance
 their
 antagon
istic
 functions
,
 acting
 like
 a
 safety
 inter
lock
 to
 prevent
 sustained
 gene
 activation
 when
 destabil
ized
.


Now
,
 I
'll
 break
 this
 down
 into
 the
 relevant
 ont
ologies
.


Starting
 with
 the
 Cell
 Ont
ology
 (
CL
),
 I
 need
 terms
 related
 to
 E
3
 lig
ases
 and
 their
 functions
.
 CL
 terms
 might
 include
 '
E
3
 ubiqu
itin
 lig
ase
'
 and
 '
ub
iqu
itin
-pro
te
as
ome
 system
'
 since
 those
 are
 specific
 cell
 components
.


Next
,
 for
 Gene
 Ont
ology
 (
GO
),
 I
 should
 cover
 both
 biological
 processes
 and
 molecular
 functions
.
 Processes
 include
 prote
ol
ysis
,
 transcription
,
 and
 regulation
 of
 gene
 expression
.
 Molecular
 functions
 would
 involve
 lig
ase
 activity
,
 specifically
 ubiqu
itin
 lig
ase
,
 and
 transcription
al
 activation
.


Moving
 on
 to
 Me
SH
 terms
,
 these
 are
 broader
 and
 might
 include
 topics
 like
 Ub
iqu
itin
-Pro
te
as
ome
 System
,
 Gene
 Expression
 Regulation
,
 and
 Trans
cription
,
 Genetic
.
 Also
,
 since
 the
 study
 mentions
 mathematical
 modeling
,
 terms
 like
 Models
,
 The
oretical
 and
 Systems
 Biology
 could
 be
 relevant
.


I
 should
 ensure
 that
 each
 term
 is
 correctly
 categorized
 under
 its
 respective
 ontology
.
 I
'll
 structure
 the
 JSON
 with
 separate
 sections
 for
 each
 ontology
 type
,
 listing
 the
 relevant
 terms
 as
 arrays
.


I
 also
 need
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 the
 terms
 are
 accurate
 and
 directly
 relate
 to
 the
 description
 provided
.
 For
 example
,
 '
s
afety
 inter
lock
 device
'
 isn
't
 a
 biological
 term
,
 so
 it
's
 more
 of
 an
 analogy
 and
 might
 not
 have
 a
 direct
 ontology
 term
,
 but
 the
 concept
 relates
 to
 system
 stability
,
 which
 ties
 into
 regulation
 and
 systems
 biology
 in
 Me
SH
.


Finally
,
 I
'll
 format
 everything
 into
 a
 JSON
 object
,
 ensuring
 proper
 syntax
 and
 structure
.
 Each
 category
 will
 have
 its
 own
 key
 with
 an
 array
 of
 terms
.
 This
 should
 provide
 a
 clear
 and
 organized
 annotation
 based
 on
 the
 provided
 information
.
