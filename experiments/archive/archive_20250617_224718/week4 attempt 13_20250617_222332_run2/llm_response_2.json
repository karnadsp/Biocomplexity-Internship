    "prompt": "Original description: This paper presents simulations of in vitro Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). The conditions of 2D migration on the surface, and 3D invasion into a collagen gel are represented as a cellular Potts model. The model demonstrates that a loss of endocardial adhesion is a sufficient condition for 2D migration behaviour, while a simultaneous loss of endocardial cohesion and gain in endocardial to collagen gel adhesion is a sufficient condition for 3D invasion. The 3D model captures the hierarchy effective surface tensions that correspond to the three experimental conditions of stable monolayer, 2D migration, and 3D invasion. A 2D cellular Potts model is used to investigate the relationship between cell shape changes, motility and adhesion during the condition of 2D migration.\n\nClarifications provided: \n\n\n    Return ONLY a JSON object with ontology annotations.",

    "response": "<think> \n Okay ,  I  need  to  create  a  JSON  object  with  ontology  annotations  based  on  the  provided  information .  The  user  mentioned  including  Cell  Ont ology ,  GO ,  and  Me SH  terms  where  applicable .  \n\n First ,  I 'll  read  the  original  description  carefully .  It 's  about  simulations  of  Ep ith elial  to  Mes ench ym al  Transition  ( EM T )  in  vitro .  The  study  uses  a  cellular  P otts  model  to  simulate   2 D  migration  and   3 D  invasion  into  a  collagen  gel .  The  model  shows  that  losing  end ocard ial  ad hesion  is  enough  for   2 D  migration ,  while  losing  cohesion  and  gaining  ad hesion  to  collagen  enables   3 D  invasion .  There 's  also  a  hierarchy  of  surface  tensions  captured  in  the   3 D  model  corresponding  to  three  experimental  conditions :  stable  mon ol ayer ,   2 D  migration ,  and   3 D  invasion .  A   2 D  model  investigates  cell  shape  changes ,  mot ility ,  and  ad hesion  during   2 D  migration .\n\n Now ,  I 'll  break  this  down  into  categories :  Cell  Ont ology ,  Gene  Ont ology ,  and  Me SH  terms .\n\n For  Cell  Ont ology ,  I  should  identify  cell  types  and  processes .  The  main  cell  type  here  is  the  end ocard ial  cell ,  so  I 'll  include  that .  Processes  include  E MT ,  cell  migration  ( both   2 D  and   3 D ),  and  cell  ad hesion .  Coh esion  and  mot ility  are  also  relevant ,  so  I 'll  add  those  terms .\n\n Moving  to  Gene  Ont ology ,  biological  processes  are  important .  E MT ,  cell  migration ,  ad hesion ,  cohesion ,  and  mot ility  are  all  biological  processes .  The  cellular  P otts  model  relates  to  cell  shape  changes ,  so  I 'll  include  that  as  well .  For  molecular  functions ,  cell  ad hesion  and  mot ility  are  key .  Since  the  model  involves  simulations ,  I 'll  add  \" model ing \"  as  a  biological  process .\n\n Me SH  terms  should  cover  the  broader  biological  concepts .  E MT  is  a  Me SH  term .  Cell  migration ,  ad hesion ,  and  mot ility  are  all  relevant .  The  cellular  P otts  model  is  a  computational  method ,  so  I 'll  include  that .  Coll agen  g els  are  mentioned ,  so  that 's  another  Me SH  term .  The  study  is  in  vitro ,  so  I 'll  add  that  as  well .\n\n I  need  to  make  sure  each  term  is  correctly  categorized  under  the  right  ontology .  I 'll  structure  the  JSON  with  separate  sections  for  each  ontology  type ,  listing  the  relevant  terms  as  arrays .\n\n I  should  double -check  that  each  term  is  accurate  and  applicable .  For  example ,  \" cell  cohesion \"  under  Cell  Ont ology  might  be  more  accurately  \" cell -cell  ad hesion \"  or  \" cell  cohesion ,\"  but  since  the  description  mentions  loss  of  cohesion ,  I 'll  stick  with  \" cell  cohesion .\"  Similarly ,  for  Me SH ,  \" Models ,  Biological \"  might  be  a  better  fit  than  just  \" model ing ,\"  but  I 'll  go  with  \" Cell ular  P otts  model \"  as  it 's  specific .\n\n Finally ,  I 'll  format  the  JSON  correctly ,  ensuring  proper  syntax  with  commas  and  brackets .  No  explanations  or  additional  text  should  be  included ,  just  the  JSON  object .\n </think> \n\n ``` json \n {\n    \" Cell  Ont ology \":  [\n      \" end ocard ial  cell \",\n      \" ep ith elial  cell \",\n      \" mes ench ym al  cell \",\n      \" cell  migration \",\n      \" cell  ad hesion \",\n      \" ep ith elial  to  mes ench ym al  transition \",\n      \" cell  cohesion \",\n      \" cell  mot ility \"\n    ],\n    \" Gene  Ont ology \":  [\n      \" ep ith elial  to  mes ench ym al  transition \",\n      \" cell  migration \",\n      \" cell  ad hesion \",\n      \" cell  cohesion \",\n      \" cell  mot ility \",\n      \" cell  shape \",\n      \" coll agen \",\n      \" cell ular  P otts  model \"\n    ],\n    \" Me SH \":  [\n      \" Ep ith elial -M es ench ym al  Transition \",\n      \" Cell  Migration \",\n      \" Cell  Ad hesion \",\n      \" Coll agen \",\n      \" G els \",\n      \" Models ,  Biological \",\n      \" Cell  Mot ility \",\n      \" In  Vit ro  Techniques \"\n    ]\n }\n ``` "
