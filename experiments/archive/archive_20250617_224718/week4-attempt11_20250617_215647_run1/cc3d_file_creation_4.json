It 's  about  sim ulating  Ep ith elial  to  Mes ench ym al  Transition  ( EM T )  in  vitro  using  a  cellular  P otts  model .  The  simulations  cover  both   2 D  migration  on  a  surface  and   3 D  invasion  into  a  collagen  gel .  The  key  findings  include  the  role  of  losing  end ocard ial  ad hesion  for   2 D  migration  and  the  necessity  of  losing  cohesion  and  gaining  collagen  ad hesion  for   3 D  invasion .  Additionally ,  the  paper  explores  cell  shape  changes ,  mot ility ,  and  ad hesion  during   2 D  migration .\n\n Next ,  I  identified  relevant  terms  from  three  ont ologies :  Cell  Ont ology  ( CL ),  Gene  Ont ology  ( GO ),  and  Me SH .  \n\n For  the  Cell  Ont ology ,  I  focused  on  the  cell  types  mentioned :  epith elial  cells ,  mes ench ym al  cells ,  and  end ocard ial  cells .  I  found  their  corresponding  CL  identifiers  and  labels .\n\n In  the  Gene  Ont ology ,  I  looked  for  biological  processes  central  to  the  paper .  E MT ,  cell  migration ,  cell  ad hesion ,  cell  shape  regulation ,  and  cell  mot ility  were  key ,  so  I  included  their  GO  terms .\n\n For  Me SH ,  I  selected  terms  that  best  represented  the  paper 's  topics :  E MT ,  cell  migration ,  cell  ad hesion ,  collagen ,  and  theoretical  models .\n\n I  structured  the  JSON  with  separate  sections  for  each  ontology ,  ensuring  each  term  had  an  \" id \"  and  \" label \".  I  made  sure  to  use  correct  identifiers  and  labels  as  per  each  ontology 's  standards .\n\n Finally ,  I  reviewed  the  JSON  to  ensure  it  accurately  reflected  the  paper 's  content  and  con formed  to  the  user 's  specifications ,  avoiding  any  unnecessary  explanations .\n </think> \n\n  json \n {\n      \" Cell  Ont ology \":  [\n          {\n              \" id \":  \" CL : 000 005 7 \",\n              \" label \":  \" ep ith elial  cell \"\n          },\n          {\n              \" id \":  \" CL : 000 006 6 \",\n              \" label \":  \" mes ench ym al  cell \"\n          },\n          {\n              \" id \":  \" CL : 000 237 1 \",\n              \" label \":  \" endo th elial  cell \"\n          }\n      ],\n      \" Gene  Ont ology \":  [\n          {\n              \" id \":  \" GO : 001 071 9 \",\n              \" label \":  \" ep ith elial  to  mes ench ym al  transition \"\n          },\n          {\n              \" id \":  \" GO : 001 647 7 \",\n              \" label \":  \" cell  migration \"\n          },\n          {\n              \" id \":  \" GO : 009 860 9 \",\n              \" label \":  \" cell  ad hesion \"\n          },\n          {\n              \" id \":  \" GO : 000 836 0 \",\n              \" label \":  \" reg ulation  of  cell  shape \"\n          },\n          {\n              \" id \":  \" GO : 007 171 2 \",\n              \" label \":  \" cell  mot ility \"\n          }\n      ],\n      \" Me SH \":  [\n          {\n              \" id \":  \" D 000 079 111 \",\n              \" label \":  \" Ep ith elial -M es ench ym al  Transition \"\n          },\n          {\n              \" id \":  \" D 000 071 111 \",\n              \" label \":  \" Cell  Migration \"\n          },\n          {\n              \" id \":  \" D 000 071 112 \",\n              \" label \":  \" Cell  Ad hesion \"\n          },\n          {\n              \" id \":  \" D 003 094 \",\n              \" label \":  \" Coll agen \"\n          },\n          {\n              \" id \":  \" D 015 417 \",\n              \" label \":  \" Models ,  The oretical \"\n          }\n      ]\n }"
