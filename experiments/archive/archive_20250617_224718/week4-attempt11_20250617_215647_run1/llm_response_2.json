    "prompt": "Original description: This paper presents simulations of in vitro Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). The conditions of 2D migration on the surface, and 3D invasion into a collagen gel are represented as a cellular Potts model. The model demonstrates that a loss of endocardial adhesion is a sufficient condition for 2D migration behaviour, while a simultaneous loss of endocardial cohesion and gain in endocardial to collagen gel adhesion is a sufficient condition for 3D invasion. The 3D model captures the hierarchy effective surface tensions that correspond to the three experimental conditions of stable monolayer, 2D migration, and 3D invasion. A 2D cellular Potts model is used to investigate the relationship between cell shape changes, motility and adhesion during the condition of 2D migration.\n\nClarifications provided: \n\n\n    Return ONLY a JSON object with ontology annotations.",

    "response": "<think> \n Okay ,  I  need  to  create  a  JSON  object  with  ontology  annotations  based  on  the  provided  paper  description .  The  user  has  specified  that  I  should  use  Cell  Ont ology ,  GO ,  and  Me SH  terms  where  applicable .  \n\n First ,  I 'll  break  down  the  paper 's  content .  It 's  about  simulations  of  Ep ith elial  to  Mes ench ym al  Transition  ( EM T )  in  vitro .  The  simulations  use  a  cellular  P otts  model  to  represent   2 D  migration  on  a  surface  and   3 D  invasion  into  a  collagen  gel .  The  model  shows  that  losing  end ocard ial  ad hesion  is  enough  for   2 D  migration ,  while  losing  cohesion  and  gaining  ad hesion  to  collagen  enables   3 D  invasion .  There 's  also  a  hierarchy  of  surface  tensions  captured  in  the   3 D  model  corresponding  to  three  experimental  conditions :  stable  mon ol ayer ,   2 D  migration ,  and   3 D  invasion .  Additionally ,  a   2 D  model  investigates  how  cell  shape  changes ,  mot ility ,  and  ad hesion  relate  during   2 D  migration .\n\n Now ,  I 'll  identify  relevant  terms  for  each  ontology .\n\n Starting  with  Cell  Ont ology  ( CL ):  The  paper  mentions  epith elial  cells ,  mes ench ym al  cells ,  and  end ocard ial  cells .  So ,  I 'll  include  CL  terms  for  these .\n\n For  Gene  Ont ology  ( GO ),  biological  processes  like  E MT ,  cell  migration ,  and  cell  ad hesion  are  central .  Also ,  the  cellular  P otts  model  relates  to  cell  shape  changes  and  mot ility .  So ,  I 'll  include  GO  terms  for  E MT ,  cell  migration ,  cell  ad hesion ,  cell  shape ,  and  cell  mot ility .\n\n In  Me SH  terms ,  the  paper  deals  with  E MT ,  cell  migration ,  cell  ad hesion ,  collagen ,  and  models  ( the oretical ).  So ,  I 'll  include  these  Me SH  headings .\n\n I 'll  structure  the  JSON  with  keys  for  each  ontology  type ,  each  containing  a  list  of  relevant  terms .  I 'll  make  sure  to  use  the  correct  identifiers  and  labels  as  per  the  ont ologies .\n\n I  should  avoid  any  explanations  and  just  provide  the  JSON .  Let  me  double -check  each  term  to  ensure  they 're  accurate  and  relevant  to  the  paper 's  content .\n </think> \n\n ``` json \n {\n    \" Cell  Ont ology \":  [\n      {\n        \" id \":  \" CL : 000 005 7 \",\n        \" label \":  \" ep ith elial  cell \"\n      },\n      {\n        \" id \":  \" CL : 000 006 6 \",\n        \" label \":  \" mes ench ym al  cell \"\n      },\n      {\n        \" id \":  \" CL : 000 237 1 \",\n        \" label \":  \" end ocard ial  cell \"\n      }\n    ],\n    \" Gene  Ont ology \":  [\n      {\n        \" id \":  \" GO : 001 071 9 \",\n        \" label \":  \" ep ith elial  to  mes ench ym al  transition \"\n      },\n      {\n        \" id \":  \" GO : 001 647 7 \",\n        \" label \":  \" cell  migration \"\n      },\n      {\n        \" id \":  \" GO : 009 860 9 \",\n        \" label \":  \" cell  ad hesion \"\n      },\n      {\n        \" id \":  \" GO : 000 836 0 \",\n        \" label \":  \" reg ulation  of  cell  shape \"\n      },\n      {\n        \" id \":  \" GO : 007 171 2 \",\n        \" label \":  \" cell  mot ility \"\n      }\n    ],\n    \" Me SH \":  [\n      {\n        \" id \":  \" D 000 079 111 \",\n        \" label \":  \" Ep ith elial -M es ench ym al  Transition \"\n      },\n      {\n        \" id \":  \" D 000 071 111 \",\n        \" label \":  \" Cell  Migration \"\n      },\n      {\n        \" id \":  \" D 000 071 112 \",\n        \" label \":  \" Cell  Ad hesion \"\n      },\n      {\n        \" id \":  \" D 003 094 \",\n        \" label \":  \" Coll agen \"\n      },\n      {\n        \" id \":  \" D 015 417 \",\n        \" label \":  \" Models ,  The oretical \"\n      }\n    ]\n }\n ``` "
