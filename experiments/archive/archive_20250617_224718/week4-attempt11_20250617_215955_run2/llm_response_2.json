    "prompt": "Original description: This paper presents simulations of in vitro Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). The conditions of 2D migration on the surface, and 3D invasion into a collagen gel are represented as a cellular Potts model. The model demonstrates that a loss of endocardial adhesion is a sufficient condition for 2D migration behaviour, while a simultaneous loss of endocardial cohesion and gain in endocardial to collagen gel adhesion is a sufficient condition for 3D invasion. The 3D model captures the hierarchy effective surface tensions that correspond to the three experimental conditions of stable monolayer, 2D migration, and 3D invasion. A 2D cellular Potts model is used to investigate the relationship between cell shape changes, motility and adhesion during the condition of 2D migration.\n\nClarifications provided: \n\n\n    Return ONLY a JSON object with ontology annotations.",

    "response": "<think> \n Alright ,  I  need  to  create  a  JSON  object  with  ontology  annotations  based  on  the  provided  information .  The  user  has  specified  that  I  should  include  terms  from  Cell  Ont ology ,  GO ,  and  Me SH  where  applicable .  \n\n First ,  I 'll  read  through  the  original  description  and  clar ifications  carefully  to  extract  the  key  biological  concepts .  The  paper  is  about  simulations  of  Ep ith elial  to  Mes ench ym al  Transition  ( EM T )  in  vitro .  They  mention   2 D  migration  on  a  surface  and   3 D  invasion  into  a  collagen  gel ,  modeled  using  a  cellular  P otts  model .  \n\n I  should  identify  the  main  biological  processes  involved .  E MT  is  a  key  process ,  so  I 'll  include  that .  Cell  migration  is  mentioned  in  both   2 D  and   3 D  contexts ,  so  those  should  be  separate  terms .  Cell  ad hesion  is  discussed ,  particularly  the  loss  of  end ocard ial  ad hesion  and  cohesion ,  so  that 's  another  important  term .  \n\n Looking  at  the  models  mentioned ,  the  cellular  P otts  model  is  a  computational  method ,  so  I 'll  include  that  under  Cell  Ont ology .  The  collagen  gel  is  a   3 D  environment ,  so  I 'll  note  that  as  part  of  the  environment .  \n\n For  the  GO  terms ,  I 'll  focus  on  biological  processes .  Cell  migration ,  ad hesion ,  and  shape  changes  are  all  relevant .  E MT  itself  is  a  biological  process ,  so  that  should  be  included .  \n\n Me SH  terms  are  broader  and  often  used  for  literature  categor ization .  I 'll  include  terms  like  Cell  Migration ,  Cell  Ad hesion ,  Models ,  Biological ,  and  Coll agen .  E MT  isn 't  a  Me SH  term ,  so  I 'll  use  the  closest  related ,  which  is  Ep ith elial -M es ench ym al  Transition .\n\n I  need  to  structure  these  into  a  JSON  object  with  categories  for  each  ontology  type .  I 'll  make  sure  each  term  is  correctly  placed  under  its  respective  ontology .  \n\n I  should  avoid  any  explanations  or  thinking  process ,  just  the  JSON .  Also ,  ensure  that  the  terms  are  accurate  and  relevant  to  the  context  provided .\n </think> \n\n ``` json \n {\n    \" Cell  Ont ology \":  [\n      \" ep ith elial  cell \",\n      \" mes ench ym al  cell \",\n      \" end ocard ial  cell \",\n      \" coll agen  gel \",\n      \" cell ular  P otts  model \"\n    ],\n    \" Gene  Ont ology \":  [\n      \" ep ith elial  to  mes ench ym al  transition \",\n      \" cell  migration \",\n      \" cell  ad hesion \",\n      \" cell  shape \",\n      \" mot ility \",\n      \" surface  tension \",\n      \" mon ol ayer \",\n      \" coll agen \"\n    ],\n    \" Me SH \":  [\n      \" Cell  Migration \",\n      \" Cell  Ad hesion \",\n      \" Models ,  Biological \",\n      \" Coll agen \",\n      \" Ep ith elial -M es ench ym al  Transition \"\n    ]\n }\n ``` "
