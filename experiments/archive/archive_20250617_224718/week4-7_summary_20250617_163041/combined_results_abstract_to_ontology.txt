Initial Description:
- E3 ubiquitin ligases are important cellular components that determine the specificity of proteolysis in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. However, an increasing number of studies have indicated that E3 ubiquitin ligases also participate in transcription. Intrigued by the apparently paradoxical functions of E3 ubiquitin ligases in both proteolysis and transcriptional activation, we investigated the underlying design principles using mathematical modeling. We found that the antagonistic functions integrated in E3 ubiquitin ligases can prevent any undesirable sustained activation of downstream genes when E3 ubiquitin ligases are destabilized by unexpected perturbations. Interestingly, this design principle of the system is similar to the operational principle of a safety interlock device in engineering systems, which prevents a system from abnormal operation unless stability is guaranteed.

Ontology Annotations:
<think>


Okay
,
 I
 need
 to
 create
 a
 structured
 ontology
 annotation
 based
 on
 the
 provided
 information
 about
 E
3
 ubiqu
itin
 lig
ases
.
 The
 user
 wants
 this
 in
 JSON
 format
,
 categor
izing
 different
 ontology
 types
 like
 Cell
 Ont
ology
,
 GO
,
 and
 Me
SH
.
 


First
,
 I
'll
 read
 through
 the
 original
 description
 to
 understand
 the
 key
 points
.
 E
3
 ubiqu
itin
 lig
ases
 are
 involved
 in
 prote
ol
ysis
 via
 the
 ubiqu
itin
-pro
te
as
ome
 system
 and
 also
 play
 a
 role
 in
 transcription
.
 The
 study
 uses
 mathematical
 modeling
 to
 explore
 how
 these
 lig
ases
 balance
 their
 antagon
istic
 functions
,
 acting
 like
 a
 safety
 inter
lock
 to
 prevent
 sustained
 gene
 activation
 when
 destabil
ized
.


Now
,
 I
'll
 break
 this
 down
 into
 the
 relevant
 ont
ologies
.


Starting
 with
 the
 Cell
 Ont
ology
 (
CL
),
 I
 need
 terms
 related
 to
 E
3
 lig
ases
 and
 their
 functions
.
 CL
 terms
 might
 include
 '
E
3
 ubiqu
itin
 lig
ase
'
 and
 '
ub
iqu
itin
-pro
te
as
ome
 system
'
 since
 those
 are
 specific
 cell
 components
.


Next
,
 for
 Gene
 Ont
ology
 (
GO
),
 I
 should
 cover
 both
 biological
 processes
 and
 molecular
 functions
.
 Processes
 include
 prote
ol
ysis
,
 transcription
,
 and
 regulation
 of
 gene
 expression
.
 Molecular
 functions
 would
 involve
 lig
ase
 activity
,
 specifically
 ubiqu
itin
 lig
ase
,
 and
 transcription
al
 activation
.


Moving
 on
 to
 Me
SH
 terms
,
 these
 are
 broader
 and
 might
 include
 topics
 like
 Ub
iqu
itin
-Pro
te
as
ome
 System
,
 Gene
 Expression
 Regulation
,
 and
 Trans
cription
,
 Genetic
.
 Also
,
 since
 the
 study
 mentions
 mathematical
 modeling
,
 terms
 like
 Models
,
 The
oretical
 and
 Systems
 Biology
 could
 be
 relevant
.


I
 should
 ensure
 that
 each
 term
 is
 correctly
 categorized
 under
 its
 respective
 ontology
.
 I
'll
 structure
 the
 JSON
 with
 separate
 sections
 for
 each
 ontology
 type
,
 listing
 the
 relevant
 terms
 as
 arrays
.


I
 also
 need
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 the
 terms
 are
 accurate
 and
 directly
 relate
 to
 the
 description
 provided
.
 For
 example
,
 '
s
afety
 inter
lock
 device
'
 isn
't
 a
 biological
 term
,
 so
 it
's
 more
 of
 an
 analogy
 and
 might
 not
 have
 a
 direct
 ontology
 term
,
 but
 the
 concept
 relates
 to
 system
 stability
,
 which
 ties
 into
 regulation
 and
 systems
 biology
 in
 Me
SH
.


Finally
,
 I
'll
 format
 everything
 into
 a
 JSON
 object
,
 ensuring
 proper
 syntax
 and
 structure
.
 Each
 category
 will
 have
 its
 own
 key
 with
 an
 array
 of
 terms
.
 This
 should
 provide
 a
 clear
 and
 organized
 annotation
 based
 on
 the
 provided
 information
.

Okay
,
 so
 I
 need
 to
 create
 structured
 ontology
 annotations
 based
 on
 the
 provided
 information
 about
 E
3
 ubiqu
itin
 lig
ases
.
 The
 user
 wants
 me
 to
 include
 relevant
 terms
 from
 Cell
 Ont
ology
,
 Gene
 Ont
ology
 (
GO
),
 and
 Me
SH
.
 I
 should
 format
 the
 response
 as
 a
 JSON
 object
 with
 categories
 for
 each
 ontology
 type
.


First
,
 I
'll
 read
 through
 the
 original
 description
 and
 clar
ifications
 carefully
 to
 understand
 the
 key
 concepts
.
 The
 main
 focus
 is
 on
 E
3
 ubiqu
itin
 lig
ases
 and
 their
 dual
 roles
 in
 prote
ol
ysis
 and
 transcription
.
 They
 also
 mention
 mathematical
 modeling
 and
 a
 safety
 inter
lock
 mechanism
.


Starting
 with
 Cell
 Ont
ology
,
 I
 know
 that
 E
3
 ubiqu
itin
 lig
ases
 are
 proteins
 involved
 in
 the
 ubiqu
it
ination
 process
.
 So
,
 I
'll
 look
 for
 terms
 related
 to
 E
3
 lig
ases
,
 the
 ubiqu
itin
-pro
te
as
ome
 system
,
 and
 cellular
 components
 involved
 in
 prote
ol
ysis
 and
 transcription
.
 Terms
 like
 "
E
3
 ubiqu
itin
 lig
ase
",
 "
ub
iqu
itin
-pro
te
as
ome
 system
",
 and
 "
cell
 nucleus
"
 come
 to
 mind
 since
 transcription
 happens
 in
 the
 nucleus
.


Next
,
 for
 Gene
 Ont
ology
,
 I
 need
 both
 Biological
 Process
 and
 Molecular
 Function
 terms
.
 The
 processes
 include
 protein
 ubiqu
it
ination
,
 prote
ol
ysis
,
 transcription
 regulation
,
 and
 gene
 expression
.
 Molecular
 functions
 would
 involve
 lig
ase
 activity
,
 specifically
 ubiqu
itin
 lig
ase
,
 and
 transcription
 factor
 activity
 since
 they
're
 involved
 in
 activating
 transcription
.


Moving
 on
 to
 Me
SH
 terms
,
 these
 are
 more
 general
 and
 used
 for
 literature
 indexing
.
 I
'll
 think
 about
 broader
 categories
 like
 Ub
iqu
itin
-Pro
te
as
ome
 System
,
 Prote
ol
ysis
,
 Trans
cription
,
 Genetic
,
 and
 Mathematical
 Modeling
.
 Also
,
 systems
 biology
 and
 engineering
 principles
 like
 Safety
 inter
lock
 devices
 might
 be
 relevant
,
 but
 I
'm
 not
 sure
 if
 Me
SH
 has
 something
 specific
 for
 that
.
 Maybe
 under
 systems
 integration
 or
 something
 similar
.


I
 should
 ensure
 that
 each
 term
 is
 correctly
 mapped
 and
 relevant
.
 I
'll
 cross
-check
 each
 term
 to
 make
 sure
 they
 accurately
 represent
 the
 concepts
 in
 the
 description
.
 For
 example
,
 "
ub
iqu
itin
-pro
te
as
ome
 system
"
 is
 a
 well
-established
 term
 in
 all
 three
 ont
ologies
,
 so
 that
's
 a
 safe
 inclusion
.


I
 also
 need
 to
 structure
 the
 JSON
 properly
,
 with
 each
 ontology
 as
 a
 key
 and
 an
 array
 of
 terms
 as
 the
 value
.
 I
'll
 make
 sure
 the
 JSON
 syntax
 is
 correct
,
 with
 proper
 commas
 and
 brackets
.


Wait
,
 in
 the
 original
 response
,
 under
 Me
SH
,
 there
's
 a
 term
 "
Safety
 inter
lock
 devices
".
 I
'm
 not
 entirely
 sure
 if
 that
's
 a
 standard
 Me
SH
 term
.
 Maybe
 it
's
 better
 to
 look
 for
 a
 more
 relevant
 Me
SH
 term
 related
 to
 systems
 biology
 or
 engineering
 principles
.
 Alternatively
,
 if
 it
's
 not
 available
,
 perhaps
 it
's
 better
 to
 omit
 it
 to
 avoid
 inaccur
acies
.


Alternatively
,
 I
 can
 include
 it
 if
 I
'm
 confident
 it
's
 correct
,
 but
 I
 should
 verify
.
 Since
 I
 can
't
 access
 external
 databases
 right
 now
,
 I
'll
 proceed
 with
 the
 terms
 I
'm
 certain
 about
 and
 maybe
 exclude
 the
 safety
 inter
lock
 unless
 it
's
 a
 recognized
 Me
SH
 term
.


Putting
 it
 all
 together
,
 I
'll
 structure
 the
 JSON
 with
 each
 ontology
 section
,
 listing
 the
 relevant
 terms
 I
've
 identified
.
 I
'll
 make
 sure
 each
 term
 is
 a
 string
 in
 the
 array
 and
 that
 the
 overall
 structure
 is
 valid
 JSON
.


I
 think
 that
's
 about
 it
.
 Now
,
 I
'll
 format
 the
 JSON
 accordingly
,
 ensuring
 each
 part
 is
 correctly
 placed
 and
 the
 terms
 are
 accurately
 represented
.

=== Run 3 ===

Experiment: week4-7
Date: 20250617_162928
Run Number: 3

Initial Description:
- E3 ubiquitin ligases are important cellular components that determine the specificity of proteolysis in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. However, an increasing number of studies have indicated that E3 ubiquitin ligases also participate in transcription. Intrigued by the apparently paradoxical functions of E3 ubiquitin ligases in both proteolysis and transcriptional activation, we investigated the underlying design principles using mathematical modeling. We found that the antagonistic functions integrated in E3 ubiquitin ligases can prevent any undesirable sustained activation of downstream genes when E3 ubiquitin ligases are destabilized by unexpected perturbations. Interestingly, this design principle of the system is similar to the operational principle of a safety interlock device in engineering systems, which prevents a system from abnormal operation unless stability is guaranteed.

Ontology Annotations:
<think>


Alright
,
 I
 need
 to
 create
 structured
 ontology
 annotations
 based
 on
 the
 provided
 information
 about
 E
3
 ubiqu
itin
 lig
ases
.
 The
 user
 wants
 me
 to
 include
 relevant
 terms
 from
 Cell
 Ont
ology
,
 Gene
 Ont
ology
 (
GO
),
 and
 Me
SH
.
 I
'll
 format
 the
 response
 as
 a
 JSON
 object
 with
 categories
 for
 each
 ontology
 type
.


First
,
 I
'll
 start
 by
 identifying
 the
 key
 biological
 concepts
 in
 the
 description
.
 The
 main
 focus
 is
 on
 E
3
 ubiqu
itin
 lig
ases
,
 their
 role
 in
 prote
ol
ysis
 via
 the
 ubiqu
itin
-pro
te
as
ome
 system
,
 and
 their
 involvement
 in
 transcription
.
 There
's
 also
 a
 mention
 of
 mathematical
 modeling
 and
 a
 comparison
 to
 engineering
 safety
 mechanisms
.


For
 the
 Cell
 Ont
ology
,
 I
'll
 look
 for
 terms
 related
 to
 E
3
 ubiqu
itin
 lig
ases
.
 The
 term
 "
E
3
 ubiqu
itin
 lig
ase
"
 itself
 is
 a
 protein
,
 so
 I
'll
 include
 that
.
 Since
 the
 description
 talks
 about
 their
 function
 in
 prote
ol
ysis
,
 I
'll
 add
 "
ub
iqu
itin
-pro
te
as
ome
 system
"
 as
 it
's
 a
 cellular
 process
.
 Trans
cription
 is
 another
 key
 function
,
 so
 I
'll
 include
 "
trans
cription
,
 DNA
-
templ
ated
"
 under
 both
 Cell
 Ont
ology
 and
 GO
.


Moving
 on
 to
 Gene
 Ont
ology
,
 I
'll
 break
 it
 down
 into
 Biological
 Processes
,
 Molecular
 Functions
,
 and
 Cellular
 Components
.
 Under
 Biological
 Processes
,
 "
ub
iqu
itin
-dependent
 protein
 c
atab
olic
 process
"
 and
 "
trans
cription
,
 DNA
-
templ
ated
"
 fit
 well
.
 For
 Molecular
 Functions
,
 "
ub
iqu
itin
 protein
 lig
ase
 activity
"
 is
 directly
 relevant
.
 In
 Cellular
 Components
,
 the
 "
pro
te
as
ome
"
 is
 mentioned
,
 so
 that
's
 a
 good
 inclusion
.


Now
,
 for
 Me
SH
 terms
,
 I
'll
 consider
 the
 broader
 biological
 processes
 and
 systems
.
 "
Ub
iqu
itin
"
 and
 "
Pro
te
as
ome
"
 are
 clear
 choices
.
 Since
 E
3
 lig
ases
 are
 involved
 in
 both
 prote
ol
ysis
 and
 transcription
,
 terms
 like
 "
Pro
tein
 Processing
,
 Post
-
Trans
l
ational
"
 and
 "
Trans
cription
,
 Genetic
"
 are
 appropriate
.
 The
 mention
 of
 mathematical
 modeling
 and
 system
 design
 relates
 to
 "
Models
,
 Biological
"
 and
 "
Systems
 Biology
."
 The
 safety
 mechanism
 analogy
 brings
 in
 "
Safety
"
 and
 "
Engineering
."


I
'll
 structure
 all
 these
 terms
 into
 a
 JSON
 object
,
 categor
izing
 them
 under
 Cell
 Ont
ology
,
 Gene
 Ont
ology
,
 and
 Me
SH
.
 Each
 category
 will
 have
 its
 specific
 terms
 listed
 as
 arrays
.
 I
'll
 make
 sure
 each
 term
 is
 correctly
 placed
 under
 its
 respective
 ontology
 and
 sub
category
 where
 applicable
.


I
 should
 double
-check
 each
 term
 to
 ensure
 they
 accurately
 reflect
 the
 original
 description
.
 For
 example
,
 confirming
 that
 "
ub
iqu
itin
 protein
 lig
ase
 activity
"
 is
 indeed
 a
 GO
 Molecular
 Function
 term
.
 Also
,
 ensuring
 that
 Me
SH
 terms
 like
 "
Pro
tein
 Processing
,
 Post
-
Trans
l
ational
"
 are
 correctly
 categorized
 under
 broader
 biological
 processes
.


Finally
,
 I
'll
 present
 the
 JSON
 in
 a
 clear
 format
,
 making
 sure
 it
's
 valid
 and
 properly
 structured
 so
 that
 it
 can
 be
 easily
 used
 or
 parsed
 if
 needed
.
 This
 should
 compreh
ensively
 cover
 the
 biological
 aspects
 discussed
 in
 the
 original
 description
 with
 appropriate
 ontology
 annotations
.
