Initial Description:
- E3 ubiquitin ligases are important cellular components that determine the specificity of proteolysis in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. However, an increasing number of studies have indicated that E3 ubiquitin ligases also participate in transcription. Intrigued by the apparently paradoxical functions of E3 ubiquitin ligases in both proteolysis and transcriptional activation, we investigated the underlying design principles using mathematical modeling. We found that the antagonistic functions integrated in E3 ubiquitin ligases can prevent any undesirable sustained activation of downstream genes when E3 ubiquitin ligases are destabilized by unexpected perturbations. Interestingly, this design principle of the system is similar to the operational principle of a safety interlock device in engineering systems, which prevents a system from abnormal operation unless stability is guaranteed.

Ontology Annotations:
<think> Okay, so I need to create a JSON object with ontology annotations based on the provided description. Let me break this down step by step. First, I 'll read through the original description to understand the key concepts. The main focus is on E 3 ubiqu itin lig ases and their dual roles in prote ol ysis and transcription. The study uses mathematical modeling to explore how these lig ases prevent sustained activation of genes when destabil ized, liken ing it to a safety inter lock device. Now, I need to identify relevant ont ologies : Cell Ont ology (CL), Gene Ont ology (GO), and Me SH terms. Starting with Cell Ont ology, E 3 ubiqu itin lig ases are proteins involved in the ubiqu itin -pro te as ome system. So, I 'll look for terms related to lig ases and the system. I find CL _ 000 006 0 (ub iqu itin lig ase), CL _ 000 026 3 (ub iqu itin -pro te as ome system), and CL _ 000 006 1 (E 3 ubiqu itin lig ase). For Gene Ont ology, the biological processes mentioned are prote ol ysis (GO : 000 650 8), transcription (GO : 000 635 1), and regulation of gene expression (GO : 001 046 8). The molecular function is lig ase activity (GO : 001 687 4). Me SH terms should cover the broader topics. I 'll include Ub iqu itin -Pro te as ome System (D 00. 552. 949. 650), Ub iqu itin Lig ases (D 12. 644. 360. 400. 450), Prote ol ysis (G 02. 111), Trans cription, Genetic (G 02. 111. 145), and Gene Expression Regulation (G 02. 111. 145. 500). Putting it all together, I structure the JSON with each ontology type as a key and an array of terms as values. I make sure not to include any explanations, just the JSON. I double -check each term to ensure they 're accurate and relevant. That should cover all necessary annotations based on the description. </think> ``` json {" Cell Ont ology ": [" CL _ 000 006 0 : ubiqu itin lig ase ", " CL _ 000 026 3 : ubiqu itin -pro te as ome system ", " CL _ 000 006 1 : E 3 ubiqu itin lig ase "], " Gene Ont ology ": [" GO _ 000 650 8 : prote ol ysis ", " GO _ 000 635 1 : transcription, DNA - templ ated ", " GO _ 001 046 8 : regulation of gene expression ", " GO _ 001 687 4 : lig ase activity "], " Me SH ": [" D 00. 552. 949. 650 : Ub iqu itin -Pro te as ome System ", " D 12. 644. 360. 400. 450 : Ub iqu itin Lig ases ", " G 02. 111 : Prote ol ysis ", " G 02. 111. 145 : Trans cription, Genetic ", " G 02. 111. 145. 500 : Gene Expression Regulation "]} ```

Ontology Annotations:
<think> Alright, the user has provided a detailed description of a biological study focusing on E 3 ubiqu itin lig ases and their roles in prote ol ysis and transcription. They want me to create a JSON object that captures the ontology annotations relevant to this study. First, I need to identify the key biological concepts from the description. The main elements are E 3 ubiqu itin lig ases, their role in prote ol ysis, their involvement in transcription, and the regulation of gene expression. The study uses mathematical modeling to explore how these lig ases act as a safety mechanism to prevent sustained gene activation when destabil ized. Next, I 'll consider the relevant ont ologies. The user mentioned Cell Ont ology (CL), Gene Ont ology (GO), and Me SH terms. For the Cell Ont ology, I 'll look for terms related to ubiqu itin lig ases and the ubiqu itin -pro te as ome system. The relevant terms are : - CL _ 000 006 0 : ubiqu itin lig ase - CL _ 000 026 3 : ubiqu itin -pro te as ome system - CL _ 000 006 1 : E 3 ubiqu itin lig ase Moving to the Gene Ont ology, the biological processes involved are prote ol ysis, transcription, and regulation of gene expression. The molecular function is lig ase activity. So, the GO terms are : - GO _ 000 650 8 : prote ol ysis - GO _ 000 635 1 : transcription, DNA - templ ated - GO _ 001 046 8 : regulation of gene expression - GO _ 001 687 4 : lig ase activity For Me SH terms, I need broader terms that cover the study 's topics. These include : - Ub iqu itin -pro te as ome system - Ub iqu itin lig ases - Prote ol ysis - Trans cription, Genetic - Gene Expression Regulation I 'll structure the JSON object with each ontology as a key and an array of terms as values. I 'll ensure that each term is accurately represented with its ID and label. Finally, I 'll format the JSON correctly, making sure there are no explanations or additional text, just the JSON object as requested. </think> ``` json {" Cell Ont ology ": [" CL _ 000 006 0 : ubiqu itin lig ase ", " CL _ 000 026 3 : ubiqu itin -pro te as ome system ", " CL _ 000 006 1 : E 3 ubiqu itin lig ase "], " Gene Ont ology ": [" GO _ 000 650 8 : prote ol ysis ", " GO _ 000 635 1 : transcription, DNA - templ ated ", " GO _ 001 046 8 : regulation of gene expression ", " GO _ 001 687 4 : lig ase activity "], " Me SH ": [" D 00. 552. 949. 650 : Ub iqu itin -pro te as ome system ", " D 12. 644. 360. 400. 450 : Ub iqu itin lig ases ", " G 02. 111 : Prote ol ysis ", " G 02. 111. 145 : Trans cription, Genetic ", " G 02. 111. 145. 500 : Gene Expression Regulation "]} ```
