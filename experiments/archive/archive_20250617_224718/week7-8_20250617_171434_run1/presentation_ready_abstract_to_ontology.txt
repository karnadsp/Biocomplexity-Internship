Run Number: 1

Initial Description:
- E3 ubiquitin ligases are important cellular components that determine the specificity of proteolysis in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. However, an increasing number of studies have indicated that E3 ubiquitin ligases also participate in transcription. Intrigued by the apparently paradoxical functions of E3 ubiquitin ligases in both proteolysis and transcriptional activation, we investigated the underlying design principles using mathematical modeling. We found that the antagonistic functions integrated in E3 ubiquitin ligases can prevent any undesirable sustained activation of downstream genes when E3 ubiquitin ligases are destabilized by unexpected perturbations. Interestingly, this design principle of the system is similar to the operational principle of a safety interlock device in engineering systems, which prevents a system from abnormal operation unless stability is guaranteed.

Ontology Annotations:
<think>


Alright
,
 I
 need
 to
 create
 structured
 ontology
 annotations
 based
 on
 the
 provided
 information
.
 The
 user
 is
 a
 biological
 modeling
 expert
,
 so
 they
 probably
 want
 a
 detailed
 and
 accurate
 JSON
 object
 that
 includes
 relevant
 terms
 from
 Cell
 Ont
ology
,
 GO
,
 and
 Me
SH
.


First
,
 I
'll
 read
 through
 the
 original
 description
 carefully
.
 It
 talks
 about
 E
3
 ubiqu
itin
 lig
ases
 and
 their
 roles
 in
 prote
ol
ysis
 and
 transcription
.
 They
 mention
 the
 ubiqu
itin
-pro
te
as
ome
 system
 and
 transcription
al
 activation
.
 They
 also
 used
 mathematical
 modeling
 to
 study
 the
 design
 principles
 and
 found
 that
 these
 lig
ases
 act
 like
 a
 safety
 inter
lock
 to
 prevent
 sustained
 gene
 activation
 when
 destabil
ized
.


Now
,
 I
 need
 to
 break
 this
 down
 into
 different
 ont
ologies
.
 Let
's
 start
 with
 Cell
 Ont
ology
.
 The
 main
 cell
 types
 involved
 are
 probably
 E
3
 ubiqu
itin
 lig
ase
 proteins
.
 I
'll
 look
 up
 the
 exact
 Cell
 Ont
ology
 term
 for
 that
.
 Then
,
 the
 processes
 mentioned
 are
 prote
ol
ysis
,
 transcription
,
 and
 gene
 regulation
.
 I
'll
 find
 the
 appropriate
 terms
 for
 each
.


Next
,
 for
 Gene
 Ont
ology
 (
GO
),
 I
 should
 consider
 both
 biological
 processes
 and
 molecular
 functions
.
 Prote
ol
ysis
 is
 a
 biological
 process
,
 so
 I
'll
 include
 that
.
 Trans
cription
al
 activation
 is
 another
 process
.
 Molecular
 functions
 would
 include
 ubiqu
itin
 lig
ase
 activity
 and
 protein
 binding
 since
 E
3
 lig
ases
 interact
 with
 other
 proteins
.


Moving
 on
 to
 Me
SH
 terms
,
 which
 are
 more
 general
.
 I
'll
 include
 Ub
iqu
itin
-Pro
te
as
ome
 System
,
 Trans
cription
,
 Gene
 Expression
 Regulation
,
 and
 Prote
ol
ysis
.
 These
 terms
 are
 broad
 and
 fit
 well
 within
 the
 Me
SH
 framework
.


I
 should
 also
 think
 about
 any
 other
 relevant
 terms
.
 The
 study
 mentions
 mathematical
 modeling
,
 so
 maybe
 including
 that
 as
 a
 Me
SH
 term
 would
 be
 useful
.
 It
's
 a
 bit
 more
 specific
 but
 still
 relevant
.


Now
,
 I
'll
 structure
 this
 into
 a
 JSON
 object
.
 I
'll
 have
 separate
 categories
 for
 each
 ontology
 type
:
 Cell
 Ont
ology
,
 Gene
 Ont
ology
,
 and
 Me
SH
.
 Each
 category
 will
 have
 its
 own
 terms
 listed
 as
 arrays
.


I
 need
 to
 ensure
 that
 each
 term
 is
 correctly
 referenced
.
 For
 example
,
 in
 Cell
 Ont
ology
,
 E
3
 ubiqu
itin
 lig
ase
 is
 CL
:
000
267
8
.
 I
'll
 double
-check
 these
 IDs
 to
 make
 sure
 they
're
 accurate
.


Putting
 it
 all
 together
,
 the
 JSON
 should
 have
 three
 main
 keys
:
 cell
_
ontology
,
 gene
_
ontology
,
 and
 mesh
.
 Each
 key
 will
 map
 to
 an
 object
 with
 process
 and
 function
 terms
 where
 applicable
.


I
 should
 also
 consider
 if
 there
 are
 any
 other
 processes
 or
 functions
 I
 might
 have
 missed
.
 For
 instance
,
 the
 mention
 of
 design
 principles
 and
 safety
 inter
lock
 is
 more
 about
 the
 system
's
 function
,
 but
 since
 it
's
 a
 modeling
 study
,
 maybe
 including
 terms
 related
 to
 systems
 biology
 or
 mathematical
 modeling
 under
 Me
SH
 would
 add
 value
.


Finally
,
 I
'll
 review
 the
 JSON
 structure
 to
 ensure
 it
's
 correctly
 formatted
,
 with
 proper
 commas
 and
 brackets
.
 Each
 term
 should
 be
 a
 string
 within
 its
 respective
 array
.
