    "prompt": "Original description: This paper presents simulations of in vitro Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). The conditions of 2D migration on the surface, and 3D invasion into a collagen gel are represented as a cellular Potts model. The model demonstrates that a loss of endocardial adhesion is a sufficient condition for 2D migration behaviour, while a simultaneous loss of endocardial cohesion and gain in endocardial to collagen gel adhesion is a sufficient condition for 3D invasion. The 3D model captures the hierarchy effective surface tensions that correspond to the three experimental conditions of stable monolayer, 2D migration, and 3D invasion. A 2D cellular Potts model is used to investigate the relationship between cell shape changes, motility and adhesion during the condition of 2D migration.\n\nClarifications provided: \n\n\n    Return ONLY a JSON object with ontology annotations.",

    "response": "<think> \n Okay ,  so  I  need  to  create  a  JSON  object  with  ontology  annotations  based  on  the  provided  information .  The  user  mentioned  including  Cell  Ont ology ,  GO ,  and  Me SH  terms  where  applicable .  Let  me  break  down  the  original  description  to  identify  relevant  terms .\n\n First ,  the  paper  is  about  simulations  of  Ep ith elial  to  Mes ench ym al  Transition  ( EM T )  in  vitro .  So  E MT  is  a  key  term  here .  I 'll  need  to  find  the  corresponding  terms  in  each  ontology .\n\n Looking  at  Cell  Ont ology ,  E MT  is  a  process ,  so  I  should  find  the  term  for  E MT .  Maybe  something  like  \" ep ith elial  to  mes ench ym al  transition \"  in  the  Cell  Ont ology .\n\n For  GO  terms ,  E MT  is  a  biological  process .  I  recall  that  GO  has  terms  for  E MT ,  so  I 'll  include  that .  Also ,  the  paper  mentions  cell  migration  in   2 D  and   3 D ,  so  terms  like  \" cell  migration \"  and  \" 3 D  cell  migration \"  would  be  relevant .  Additionally ,  the  model  involves  cell  ad hesion ,  cohesion ,  and  shape  changes ,  so  terms  like  \" cell  ad hesion \",  \" cell  cohesion \",  and  \" cell  shape \"  should  be  included .\n\n Me SH  terms  are  broader ,  so  I 'll  look  for  terms  like  \" Ep ith elial -M es ench ym al  Transition \",  \" Cell  Migration \",  \" Coll agen \",  and  \" Models ,  Biological \"  since  the  paper  uses  a  cellular  P otts  model .\n\n Now ,  I 'll  structure  the  JSON  with  separate  categories  for  each  ontology  type .  Each  category  will  have  an  array  of  terms .  I 'll  make  sure  to  use  the  correct  identifiers  for  each  term ,  like  the  GO  ID  for  E MT .\n\n I  should  double -check  each  term  to  ensure  they 're  accurate  and  relevant .  For  example ,  \" cell  migration \"  in  GO  is  GO : 001 647 7 ,  and  \" 3 D  cell  migration \"  might  not  have  a  direct  GO  term ,  but  I  can  include  it  if  it  exists  or  find  the  closest  related  term .\n\n Wait ,  maybe  \" 3 D  cell  migration \"  isn 't  a  standard  GO  term .  I 'll  stick  to  the  standard  terms  to  avoid  errors .  So  I 'll  include  \" cell  migration \"  and  perhaps  \" cell  mot ility \"  as  well .\n\n Putting  it  all  together ,  the  JSON  structure  will  have  three  main  keys :  \" Cell  Ont ology \",  \" Gene  Ont ology \",  and  \" Me SH \".  Each  will  contain  an  array  of  terms  with  their  respective  identifiers  or  labels .\n\n I  think  that 's  all .  Now ,  I 'll  format  the  JSON  accordingly ,  ensuring  proper  syntax  and  structure .\n </think> \n\n ``` json \n {\n    \" Cell  Ont ology \":  [\n      {\n        \" term \":  \" ep ith elial  cell \",\n        \" id \":  \" CL _ 000 006 6 \"\n      },\n      {\n        \" term \":  \" mes ench ym al  cell \",\n        \" id \":  \" CL _ 000 006 7 \"\n      },\n      {\n        \" term \":  \" endo th elial  cell \",\n        \" id \":  \" CL _ 000 003 1 \"\n      }\n    ],\n    \" Gene  Ont ology \":  [\n      {\n        \" term \":  \" ep ith elial  to  mes ench ym al  transition \",\n        \" id \":  \" GO : 001 654 1 \"\n      },\n      {\n        \" term \":  \" cell  migration \",\n        \" id \":  \" GO : 001 647 7 \"\n      },\n      {\n        \" term \":  \" cell  ad hesion \",\n        \" id \":  \" GO : 000 715 5 \"\n      },\n      {\n        \" term \":  \" cell  shape \",\n        \" id \":  \" GO : 000 836 0 \"\n      },\n      {\n        \" term \":  \" cell  mot ility \",\n        \" id \":  \" GO : 004 887 0 \"\n      }\n    ],\n    \" Me SH \":  [\n      {\n        \" term \":  \" Ep ith elial -M es ench ym al  Transition \",\n        \" id \":  \" D 000 069 072 \"\n      },\n      {\n        \" term \":  \" Cell  Migration \",\n        \" id \":  \" D 002 469 \"\n      },\n      {\n        \" term \":  \" Coll agen \",\n        \" id \":  \" D 003 094 \"\n      },\n      {\n        \" term \":  \" Models ,  Biological \",\n        \" id \":  \" D 001 025 \"\n      }\n    ]\n }\n ``` "
