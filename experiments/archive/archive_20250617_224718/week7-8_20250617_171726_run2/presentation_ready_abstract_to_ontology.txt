Initial Description:
- E3 ubiquitin ligases are important cellular components that determine the specificity of proteolysis in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. However, an increasing number of studies have indicated that E3 ubiquitin ligases also participate in transcription. Intrigued by the apparently paradoxical functions of E3 ubiquitin ligases in both proteolysis and transcriptional activation, we investigated the underlying design principles using mathematical modeling. We found that the antagonistic functions integrated in E3 ubiquitin ligases can prevent any undesirable sustained activation of downstream genes when E3 ubiquitin ligases are destabilized by unexpected perturbations. Interestingly, this design principle of the system is similar to the operational principle of a safety interlock device in engineering systems, which prevents a system from abnormal operation unless stability is guaranteed.

Ontology Annotations:

Alright
,
 I
 need
 to
 create
 structured
 ontology
 annotations
 based
 on
 the
 provided
 information
 about
 E
3
 ubiqu
itin
 lig
ases
.
 The
 user
 has
 asked
 for
 a
 JSON
 object
 that
 includes
 categories
 for
 different
 ontology
 types
,
 specifically
 Cell
 Ont
ology
,
 GO
,
 and
 Me
SH
 terms
 where
 applicable
.


First
,
 I
'll
 read
 through
 the
 original
 description
 and
 clar
ifications
 carefully
 to
 understand
 the
 key
 concepts
.
 The
 description
 talks
 about
 E
3
 ubiqu
itin
 lig
ases
 being
 involved
 in
 prote
ol
ysis
 via
 the
 ubiqu
itin
-pro
te
as
ome
 system
 and
 also
 in
 transcription
.
 The
 study
 uses
 mathematical
 modeling
 to
 explore
 how
 these
 lig
ases
 can
 have
 antagon
istic
 functions
,
 acting
 as
 a
 safety
 mechanism
 similar
 to
 an
 engineering
 inter
lock
.


I
'll
 start
 by
 identifying
 the
 main
 biological
 entities
 mentioned
.
 E
3
 ubiqu
itin
 lig
ases
 are
 clearly
 the
 central
 focus
.
 Prote
ol
ysis
 and
 transcription
 are
 the
 two
 primary
 processes
 they
're
 involved
 in
.
 The
 ubiqu
itin
-pro
te
as
ome
 system
 is
 another
 key
 term
,
 as
 well
 as
 mathematical
 modeling
 and
 the
 safety
 inter
lock
 mechanism
.


Next
,
 I
'll
 map
 these
 to
 the
 appropriate
 ont
ologies
.
 For
 the
 Cell
 Ont
ology
,
 I
'll
 look
 for
 terms
 related
 to
 E
3
 lig
ases
,
 prote
ol
ysis
,
 and
 transcription
.
 The
 GO
 terms
 should
 cover
 biological
 processes
 like
 prote
ol
ysis
,
 transcription
,
 and
 regulation
 of
 gene
 expression
.
 Me
SH
 terms
 will
 be
 broader
,
 covering
 topics
 like
 ubiqu
itin
-pro
te
as
ome
 system
,
 mathematical
 models
,
 and
 systems
 biology
.


I
 need
 to
 ensure
 that
 each
 term
 is
 correctly
 referenced
.
 For
 example
,
 E
3
 ubiqu
itin
 lig
ases
 might
 map
 to
 terms
 like
 '
ub
iqu
itin
 lig
ase
'
 in
 Cell
 Ont
ology
.
 Prote
ol
ysis
 could
 be
 '
pro
te
as
omal
 protein
 c
atab
olic
 process
'
 in
 GO
.
 Me
SH
 terms
 might
 include
 '
Ub
iqu
itin
-Pro
te
as
ome
 System
'
 and
 '
Models
,
 Biological
'.


I
'll
 structure
 the
 JSON
 with
 separate
 categories
 for
 each
 ontology
 type
.
 Each
 category
 will
 be
 an
 array
 of
 objects
,
 each
 containing
 the
 term
 and
 its
 ID
.
 I
'll
 make
 sure
 the
 IDs
 are
 accurate
 and
 correspond
 to
 the
 correct
 terms
 in
 each
 ontology
.


I
 should
 also
 consider
 if
 there
 are
 any
 other
 relevant
 terms
.
 For
 instance
,
 the
 study
 mentions
 mathematical
 modeling
,
 so
 including
 terms
 related
 to
 that
 in
 GO
 and
 Me
SH
 makes
 sense
.
 The
 safety
 inter
lock
 mechanism
 is
 an
 engineering
 concept
,
 but
 in
 biological
 terms
,
 it
 relates
 to
 system
 stability
,
 so
 I
'll
 include
 terms
 that
 reflect
 that
.


Finally
,
 I
'll
 review
 the
 JSON
 structure
 to
 ensure
 it
's
 properly
 formatted
 and
 that
 each
 term
 is
 correctly
 placed
 under
 its
 respective
 ontology
.
 I
'll
 double
-check
 the
 IDs
 and
 terms
 to
 make
 sure
 they
're
 accurate
 and
 relevant
 to
 the
 provided
 information
.
