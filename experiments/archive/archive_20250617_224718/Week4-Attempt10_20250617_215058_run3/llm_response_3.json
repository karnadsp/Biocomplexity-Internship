    "prompt": "Generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file based on these ontology annotations.\n    Return ONLY the Python code:\n\n<think> Okay, I need to create a JSON object with ontology annotations based on the provided description. The user mentioned including Cell Ont ology, GO, and Me SH terms where applicable. First, I 'll read through the original description to understand the key concepts. It talks about E 3 ubiqu itin lig ases being involved in prote ol ysis via the ubiqu itin -pro te as ome system and also in transcription. The study uses mathematical modeling to explore how these lig ases balance their roles, preventing sustained gene activation when destabil ized, similar to a safety inter lock in engineering. Now, I 'll break this down into categories. For Cell Ont ology, E 3 ubiqu itin lig ases are proteins, so I 'll include that. They function in the ubiqu itin -pro te as ome system, which relates to prote as omes. Their role in transcription points to RNA polymer ase II, which is involved in transcription. Next, Gene Ont ology (GO) terms. The biological processes mentioned are prote ol ysis, transcription al activation, and gene expression regulation. Molecular functions include lig ase activity (specific ally ubiqu itin lig ase) and transcription co activ ator activity. The cellular component is the nucleus since transcription happens there. Moving to Me SH terms, E 3 ubiqu itin lig ases are enzymes. The processes discussed are prote ol ysis, gene expression, and transcription. Mathematical modeling is a research method, so that 's another term. The safety mechanism is similar to an engineering device, so systems engineering is relevant. I should make sure each category is correctly assigned and that all relevant terms are included without any explanations. Now, I 'll structure this into a JSON object with the appropriate keys and values. </think> ``` json {\" Cell Ont ology \": [\" E 3 ubiqu itin lig ase \", \" Ub iqu itin -pro te as ome system \", \" Pro te as ome \", \" RNA polymer ase II \", \" Trans cription al activation \"], \" Gene Ont ology \": [\" Pro te ol ysis \", \" Trans cription al activation \", \" Gene expression regulation \", \" Ub iqu itin lig ase activity \", \" Trans cription co activ ator activity \", \" N ucle us \"], \" Me SH \": [\" E 3 ubiqu itin lig ases \", \" Pro te ol ysis \", \" Gene expression \", \" Trans cription \", \" Math ematic al modeling \", \" Systems engineering \"]} ```",
