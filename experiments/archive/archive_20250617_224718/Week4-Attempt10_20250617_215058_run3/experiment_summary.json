        "description": "E3 ubiquitin ligases are important cellular components that determine the specificity of proteolysis in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. However, an increasing number of studies have indicated that E3 ubiquitin ligases also participate in transcription. Intrigued by the apparently paradoxical functions of E3 ubiquitin ligases in both proteolysis and transcriptional activation, we investigated the underlying design principles using mathematical modeling. We found that the antagonistic functions integrated in E3 ubiquitin ligases can prevent any undesirable sustained activation of downstream genes when E3 ubiquitin ligases are destabilized by unexpected perturbations. Interestingly, this design principle of the system is similar to the operational principle of a safety interlock device in engineering systems, which prevents a system from abnormal operation unless stability is guaranteed."

It talks about E 3 ubiqu itin lig ases being involved in prote ol ysis via the ubiqu itin -pro te as ome system and also in transcription. The study uses mathematical modeling to explore how these lig ases balance their roles, preventing sustained gene activation when destabil ized, similar to a safety inter lock in engineering. Now, I 'll break this down into categories. For Cell Ont ology, E 3 ubiqu itin lig ases are proteins, so I 'll include that. They function in the ubiqu itin -pro te as ome system, which relates to prote as omes. Their role in transcription points to RNA polymer ase II, which is involved in transcription. Next, Gene Ont ology (GO) terms. The biological processes mentioned are prote ol ysis, transcription al activation, and gene expression regulation. Molecular functions include lig ase activity (specific ally ubiqu itin lig ase) and transcription co activ ator activity. The cellular component is the nucleus since transcription happens there. Moving to Me SH terms, E 3 ubiqu itin lig ases are enzymes. The processes discussed are prote ol ysis, gene expression, and transcription. Mathematical modeling is a research method, so that 's another term. The safety mechanism is similar to an engineering device, so systems engineering is relevant.
