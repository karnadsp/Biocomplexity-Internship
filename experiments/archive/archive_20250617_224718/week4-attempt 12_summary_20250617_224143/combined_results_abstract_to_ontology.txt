Initial Description:
- This paper presents simulations of in vitro Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). The conditions of 2D migration on the surface, and 3D invasion into a collagen gel are represented as a cellular Potts model. The model demonstrates that a loss of endocardial adhesion is a sufficient condition for 2D migration behaviour, while a simultaneous loss of endocardial cohesion and gain in endocardial to collagen gel adhesion is a sufficient condition for 3D invasion. The 3D model captures the hierarchy effective surface tensions that correspond to the three experimental conditions of stable monolayer, 2D migration, and 3D invasion. A 2D cellular Potts model is used to investigate the relationship between cell shape changes, motility and adhesion during the condition of 2D migration.
