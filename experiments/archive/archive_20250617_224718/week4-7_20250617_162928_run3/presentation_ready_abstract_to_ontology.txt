Run Number: 3

Initial Description:
- E3 ubiquitin ligases are important cellular components that determine the specificity of proteolysis in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. However, an increasing number of studies have indicated that E3 ubiquitin ligases also participate in transcription. Intrigued by the apparently paradoxical functions of E3 ubiquitin ligases in both proteolysis and transcriptional activation, we investigated the underlying design principles using mathematical modeling. We found that the antagonistic functions integrated in E3 ubiquitin ligases can prevent any undesirable sustained activation of downstream genes when E3 ubiquitin ligases are destabilized by unexpected perturbations. Interestingly, this design principle of the system is similar to the operational principle of a safety interlock device in engineering systems, which prevents a system from abnormal operation unless stability is guaranteed.

Alright
,
 I
 need
 to
 create
 structured
 ontology
 annotations
 based
 on
 the
 provided
 information
 about
 E
3
 ubiqu
itin
 lig
ases
.
 The
 user
 wants
 me
 to
 include
 relevant
 terms
 from
 Cell
 Ont
ology
,
 Gene
 Ont
ology
 (
GO
),
 and
 Me
SH
.
 I
'll
 format
 the
 response
 as
 a
 JSON
 object
 with
 categories
 for
 each
 ontology
 type
.


First
,
 I
'll
 start
 by
 identifying
 the
 key
 biological
 concepts
 in
 the
 description
.
 The
 main
 focus
 is
 on
 E
3
 ubiqu
itin
 lig
ases
,
 their
 role
 in
 prote
ol
ysis
 via
 the
 ubiqu
itin
-pro
te
as
ome
 system
,
 and
 their
 involvement
 in
 transcription
.
 There
's
 also
 a
 mention
 of
 mathematical
 modeling
 and
 a
 comparison
 to
 engineering
 safety
 mechanisms
.


For
 the
 Cell
 Ont
ology
,
 I
'll
 look
 for
 terms
 related
 to
 E
3
 ubiqu
itin
 lig
ases
.
 The
 term
 "
E
3
 ubiqu
itin
 lig
ase
"
 itself
 is
 a
 protein
,
 so
 I
'll
 include
 that
.
 Since
 the
 description
 talks
 about
 their
 function
 in
 prote
ol
ysis
,
 I
'll
 add
 "
ub
iqu
itin
-pro
te
as
ome
 system
"
 as
 it
's
 a
 cellular
 process
.
 Trans
cription
 is
 another
 key
 function
,
 so
 I
'll
 include
 "
trans
cription
,
 DNA
-
templ
ated
"
 under
 both
 Cell
 Ont
ology
 and
 GO
.


Moving
 on
 to
 Gene
 Ont
ology
,
 I
'll
 break
 it
 down
 into
 Biological
 Processes
,
 Molecular
 Functions
,
 and
 Cellular
 Components
.
 Under
 Biological
 Processes
,
 "
ub
iqu
itin
-dependent
 protein
 c
atab
olic
 process
"
 and
 "
trans
cription
,
 DNA
-
templ
ated
"
 fit
 well
.
 For
 Molecular
 Functions
,
 "
ub
iqu
itin
 protein
 lig
ase
 activity
"
 is
 directly
 relevant
.
 In
 Cellular
 Components
,
 the
 "
pro
te
as
ome
"
 is
 mentioned
,
 so
 that
's
 a
 good
 inclusion
.


Now
,
 for
 Me
SH
 terms
,
 I
'll
 consider
 the
 broader
 biological
 processes
 and
 systems
.
 "
Ub
iqu
itin
"
 and
 "
Pro
te
as
ome
"
 are
 clear
 choices
.
 Since
 E
3
 lig
ases
 are
 involved
 in
 both
 prote
ol
ysis
 and
 transcription
,
 terms
 like
 "
Pro
tein
 Processing
,
 Post
-
Trans
l
ational
"
 and
 "
Trans
cription
,
 Genetic
"
 are
 appropriate
.
 The
 mention
 of
 mathematical
 modeling
 and
 system
 design
 relates
 to
 "
Models
,
 Biological
"
 and
 "
Systems
 Biology
."
 The
 safety
 mechanism
 analogy
 brings
 in
 "
Safety
"
 and
 "
Engineering
."


I
'll
 structure
 all
 these
 terms
 into
 a
 JSON
 object
,
 categor
izing
 them
 under
 Cell
 Ont
ology
,
 Gene
 Ont
ology
,
 and
 Me
SH
.
 Each
 category
 will
 have
 its
 specific
 terms
 listed
 as
 arrays
.
 I
'll
 make
 sure
 each
 term
 is
 correctly
 placed
 under
 its
 respective
 ontology
 and
 sub
category
 where
 applicable
.


I
 should
 double
-check
 each
 term
 to
 ensure
 they
 accurately
 reflect
 the
 original
 description
.
 For
 example
,
 confirming
 that
 "
ub
iqu
itin
 protein
 lig
ase
 activity
"
 is
 indeed
 a
 GO
 Molecular
 Function
 term
.
 Also
,
 ensuring
 that
 Me
SH
 terms
 like
 "
Pro
tein
 Processing
,
 Post
-
Trans
l
ational
"
 are
 correctly
 categorized
 under
 broader
 biological
 processes
.


Finally
,
 I
'll
 present
 the
 JSON
 in
 a
 clear
 format
,
 making
 sure
 it
's
 valid
 and
 properly
 structured
 so
 that
 it
 can
 be
 easily
 used
 or
 parsed
 if
 needed
.
 This
 should
 compreh
ensively
 cover
 the
 biological
 aspects
 discussed
 in
 the
 original
 description
 with
 appropriate
 ontology
 annotations
.
