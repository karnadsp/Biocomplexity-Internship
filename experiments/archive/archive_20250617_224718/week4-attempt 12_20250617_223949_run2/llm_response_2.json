    "prompt": "Original description: This paper presents simulations of in vitro Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). The conditions of 2D migration on the surface, and 3D invasion into a collagen gel are represented as a cellular Potts model. The model demonstrates that a loss of endocardial adhesion is a sufficient condition for 2D migration behaviour, while a simultaneous loss of endocardial cohesion and gain in endocardial to collagen gel adhesion is a sufficient condition for 3D invasion. The 3D model captures the hierarchy effective surface tensions that correspond to the three experimental conditions of stable monolayer, 2D migration, and 3D invasion. A 2D cellular Potts model is used to investigate the relationship between cell shape changes, motility and adhesion during the condition of 2D migration.\n\nClarifications provided: \n\n\n    Return ONLY a JSON object with ontology annotations.",

    "response": "<think> \n Alright ,  I  need  to  create  a  JSON  object  with  ontology  annotations  based  on  the  provided  paper  description .  The  user  wants  me  to  include  terms  from  Cell  Ont ology ,  GO ,  and  Me SH  where  applicable .  \n\n First ,  I 'll  read  through  the  paper  description  to  identify  key  biological  concepts .  The  paper  is  about  simulations  of  Ep ith elial  to  Mes ench ym al  Transition  ( EM T )  in  vitro .  It  mentions   2 D  migration  on  a  surface  and   3 D  invasion  into  a  collagen  gel ,  modeled  using  a  cellular  P otts  model .  \n\n I 'll  start  with  the  Cell  Ont ology .  E MT  is  a  key  process ,  so  I 'll  include  \" ep ith elial  to  mes ench ym al  transition \".  The  cells  mentioned  are  epith elial  and  mes ench ym al ,  so  those  terms  should  be  included .  The  model  involves  cell  migration ,  both   2 D  and   3 D ,  so  I 'll  add  those  as  well .  Cell  ad hesion  and  cohesion  are  also  important  factors  in  the  model .\n\n Next ,  for  Gene  Ont ology  ( GO ),  I 'll  focus  on  biological  processes .  Cell  migration ,  ad hesion ,  and  cohesion  are  relevant  here .  The  cellular  P otts  model  relates  to  cell  shape  changes  and  mot ility ,  so  those  terms  fit .  Since  E MT  is  a  biological  process ,  I 'll  include  that  too .\n\n Moving  on  to  Me SH  terms ,  I 'll  look  for  broader  biological  concepts .  E MT  is  a  Me SH  term ,  as  are  cell  migration  and  ad hesion .  The  model  uses  a  collagen  gel ,  so  \" coll agen \"  is  relevant .  The  cellular  P otts  model  itself  isn 't  a  Me SH  term ,  but  \" models ,  biological \"  is .  Cell  shape  and  mot ility  are  also  applicable .\n\n I  need  to  ensure  that  each  term  is  correctly  categorized  under  the  right  ontology .  I 'll  structure  the  JSON  with  separate  categories  for  each  ontology  type .  I 'll  avoid  any  explanations  and  just  list  the  terms .\n\n Let  me  double -check  each  term  to  make  sure  they  accurately  represent  the  paper 's  content .  Everything  seems  to  fit ,  so  I 'll  compile  the  JSON  accordingly .\n </think> \n\n ``` json \n {\n    \" Cell  Ont ology \":  [\n      \" ep ith elial  cell \",\n      \" mes ench ym al  cell \",\n      \" cell  migration \",\n      \" cell  ad hesion \",\n      \" cell  cohesion \",\n      \" ep ith elial  to  mes ench ym al  transition \"\n    ],\n    \" Gene  Ont ology \":  [\n      \" cell  migration \",\n      \" cell  ad hesion \",\n      \" cell  cohesion \",\n      \" cell  shape \",\n      \" cell  mot ility \",\n      \" ep ith elial  to  mes ench ym al  transition \"\n    ],\n    \" Me SH \":  [\n      \" Ep ith elial -M es ench ym al  Transition \",\n      \" Cell  Migration \",\n      \" Cell  Ad hesion \",\n      \" Coll agen \",\n      \" Models ,  Biological \",\n      \" Cell  Shape \",\n      \" Cell  Mot ility \"\n    ]\n }\n ``` "
