    "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file based on the given ontology annotations. The user provided a Python code example, but I have to create my own. Let me break down the requirements.\n\nFirst, the code must include the necessary imports. I'll need to import CompuCellSetup and steppables. Also, since the example used a MitosisSteppable, I should include that as well.\n\nNext, I need a simulation class that inherits from SteppableBasePy. The example used a class called Simulation, so I'll follow that structure. This class should have __init__, start, and step methods.\n\nIn the __init__ method, I'll set the number of cells to 100 and initialize the simulation. The start method will create a cell field, place cells randomly, and add a MitosisSteppable. The step method will run the simulation for 100 steps.\n\nLooking at the ontology annotations: CellOntology is Epithelial, GeneOntology mentions Cyclin-dependent Kinase Activity, and MeSH is Cell Proliferation. These suggest that cell division is a key process, so including mitosis makes sense.\n\nI'll set the mitosis parameters: minimum distance between cells, maximum number of daughters, and a duration. This aligns with the cell proliferation aspect.\n\nI'll structure the code accordingly, making sure to include all necessary components without any extra text. I'll test it in my mind to ensure it runs without errors.\n</think>\n\n```python\nfrom CompuCellSetup import Simulator\nfrom steppables import *\nfrom MitosisSteppable import MitosisSteppable\n\nclass Simulation(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, _simulator, _frequency=1):\n        SteppableBasePy.__init__(self, _simulator, _frequency)\n        self.simulator = _simulator\n        self.num_cells = 100\n        self.cell_types = ['Epithelial']\n\n    def start(self):\n        self.simulator.add_steppable(MitosisSteppable(self.simulator, {'mitosis_distance': 5, 'mitosis_max_daughters': 2, 'mitosis_duration': 10}))\n        cell_field = self.simulator.get_cell_field()\n        for _ in range(self.num_cells):\n            cell = self.simulator.cell_types['Epithelial']()\n            cell_field.add_cell_to_field(cell, (10, 10, 0))\n\n    def step(self, mcs):\n        if mcs == 100:\n            self.simulator.stop_simulation()\n\nsimulator = Simulator()\nsim = Simulation(simulator)\nsimulator.add_steppable(sim)\nsimulator.run(100)\n```"
