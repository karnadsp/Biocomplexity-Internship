    "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file based on the given ontology annotations. The user provided a Python code example, but I should think through how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the ontology includes Epithelial cells, Cell Division, and Cell Proliferation. So the simulation should model epithelial cell behavior, focusing on their division and proliferation.\n\nI'll start by importing necessary modules: CompuCellSetup and steppables. The simulation class should inherit from SteppableBasePy, so I'll set that up.\n\nIn the __init__ method, I'll initialize the steppable, set the frequency to 1 so it runs every step. I'll also define a dictionary for cell type parameters, setting epithelial cells with some volume, surface area, and proliferation parameters like max proliferation cycles and rate.\n\nThe start method is where I'll initialize the simulation. I'll create a lattice of size 100x100, add a single epithelial cell in the center. I'll also set up a mitigator to manage cell mitosis, specifying that only epithelial cells can divide.\n\nIn the step method, I'll handle cell division. I'll iterate over all cells, check if they're epithelial and ready to divide (based on a timer). When dividing, I'll reset their timer and set a new target volume. I'll also print out when a division occurs for tracking.\n\nI'll set up the simulation to run for 100 steps with output every step. Finally, I'll call CompuCellSetup.main() to execute the simulation.\n\nI need to ensure all methods are correctly implemented and that the parameters align with the ontology terms provided. This should create a simulation where epithelial cells proliferate and divide according to the specified biological processes.\n</think>\n\n```python\nfrom CompuCellSetup import Simulator\nfrom steppables import SteppableBasePy\n\nclass EpithelialProliferationSimulation(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, _simulator, _frequency=1):\n        super(EpithelialProliferationSimulation, self).__init__(_simulator, _frequency)\n        self.simulator = _simulator\n        self.cell_types = {'Epithelial': 0}\n        self.epithelial_params = {\n            'volume': 10,\n            'surface_area': 10,\n            'max_proliferation_cycles': 10,\n            'proliferation_rate': 0.1\n        }\n\n    def start(self):\n        self.simulator.createLattice(100, 100, 1)\n        self.simulator.addCell(0, 0, 0, self.cell_types['Epithelial'])\n        self.simulator.setMitigator()\n        self.simulator.setMitigator(1, self.cell_types['Epithelial'], 'Mitosis')\n\n    def step(self, mcs):\n        for cell in self.simulator.cellList:\n            if cell.type == self.cell_types['Epithelial']:\n                if cell.cellCycle[0] >= 10:\n                    cell.divide()\n                    cell.cellCycle[0] = 0\n                    cell.targetVolume = self.epithelial_params['volume']\n        self.simulator.print(\"MCS: \" + str(mcs))\n\nsim = Simulator()\nsim.addStepping(_stepping=EpithelialProliferationSimulation(sim, 1))\nsim.run(100)\n```"
