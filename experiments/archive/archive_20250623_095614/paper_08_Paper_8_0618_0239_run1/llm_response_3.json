    "response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file based on the provided ontology annotations. Let me break down the requirements and figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the user specified that the code must include certain elements: imports, a simulation class inheriting from SteppableBasePy, and specific methods like __init__, start, and step. Also, the cell types and parameters should be based on the given ontology terms.\n\nLooking at the ontology annotations, I see 'Epithelial' cells, 'Cell Division', and 'Cell Proliferation'. So, the simulation should model epithelial cell proliferation, which likely involves cell division.\n\nI'll start by importing the necessary modules. I know CompuCell3D uses CompuCellSetup and various steppables, so I'll import those.\n\nNext, I'll create a simulation class that inherits from SteppableBasePy. This class will handle the simulation logic. In the __init__ method, I'll set up the simulation, including the number of cells, lattice dimensions, and time parameters.\n\nFor the cell types, I'll define an Epithelial cell type with specific parameters like color and mechanics. Since cell division is involved, I'll set a mitosis distance to determine when a cell will divide.\n\nIn the start method, I'll initialize the simulation with the Epithelial cells placed in a 3D grid. I'll also set up a mitosis steppable to handle cell division, specifying the number of steps between divisions and the maximum number of divisions.\n\nThe step method will handle the simulation loop, incrementing the step counter and stopping the simulation after a certain number of steps.\n\nI need to ensure that all the parameters are correctly set and that the simulation runs smoothly. I'll also include a main function to initialize and run the simulation using the CompuCellSetup.\n\nFinally, I'll make sure the code is clean and only includes the necessary parts without any extra explanations or text, as per the user's request.\n</think>\n\n```python\nfrom CompuCell3D import CompuCellSetup\nfrom steppables import SteppableBasePy\n\nclass EpithelialProliferationSimulation(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, _simulator, _frequency=1):\n        SteppableBasePy.__init__(self, _simulator, _frequency)\n        self.simulator = _simulator\n        self.step = 0\n        self.max_steps = 1000\n        \n        # Initialize cell types and properties\n        self.cellType = {'Epithelial': 0}\n        \n        # Set up cell mechanics and parameters\n        self.cellMechanics = {\n            'Epithelial': {\n                'color': [255, 255, 255],\n                'latticeType': 'Hexagon',\n                'mitosisDistance': 3.0,\n                'mitosisGroup': 0,\n                'cellAdhesion': {\n                    'Epithelial': {'strength': 50.0, 'distance': 1.0}\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        \n        # Set up simulation parameters\n        self.simulator.setSimulationDimensions(50, 50, 1)\n        self.simulator.setFieldSize(50, 50, 1)\n        self.simulator.setTimeStep(0.1)\n        self.simulator.setTimeScale(1.0)\n        \n    def start(self):\n        # Initialize cells\n        for x in range(25, 26):\n            for y in range(25, 26):\n                for z in range(0, 1):\n                    cell = self.simulator.createCell(self.cellType['Epithelial'], [x, y, z])\n        \n        # Set up mitosis\n        self.mitosisSteppable = Mitosis(self.simulator, 10, 3, 100)\n        self.simulator.addSteppable(self.mitosisSteppable)\n        \n    def step(self):\n        self.step += 1\n        if self.step >= self.max_steps:\n            self.simulator.stopSimulation()\n            \ndef main():\n    simulator = CompuCellSetup.Simulator()\n    simulation = EpithelialProliferationSimulation(simulator)\n    simulator.addSteppable(simulation)\n    simulator.run(1000)\n    \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```"
