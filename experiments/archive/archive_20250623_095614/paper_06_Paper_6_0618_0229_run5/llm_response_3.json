    "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file based on the provided ontology annotations. The user has specified that the code should include certain elements like imports, a simulation class with specific methods, and cell types and parameters based on the given ontologies.\n\nFirst, I'll start by including the necessary imports. CompuCell3D requires importing CompuCellSetup and various steppables. I'll make sure to import SteppableBasePy, which is needed for creating custom steppables.\n\nNext, I'll create a simulation class that inherits from SteppableBasePy. This class will have __init__, start, and step methods. In the __init__ method, I'll set up the simulation, including the number of cells, the time parameters, and the output settings. I'll also initialize a steppable that can be used to track cell count or other metrics.\n\nIn the start method, I'll set up the initial cell layout. Since the ontology mentions Epithelial cells, I'll create a single Epithelial cell placed in the center of a 2D simulation. I'll also set the simulation box size to accommodate this cell.\n\nThe step method will handle the logic that runs every time step. Here, I'll include a simple cell division mechanism based on the GeneOntology and MeSH terms provided. Every 50 time units, each Epithelial cell will divide into two daughter cells. I'll use a loop to iterate over each cell and check if the current time step is a multiple of 50. If so, I'll call the cell.divide() method.\n\nI'll also include a Mitosis steppable to handle cell division, which is a standard module in CompuCell3D. This will ensure that the cell division process is properly managed.\n\nFinally, I'll set up the output to save the simulation state every 10 steps, which will help in tracking the cell proliferation over time.\n\nThroughout this process, I'll make sure that the code adheres to CompuCell3D's structure and that all necessary modules and parameters are correctly initialized. I'll avoid adding any extra text or explanations to keep the response clean and focused on the code.\n</think>\n\n```python\nfrom CompuCell3D import CompuCellSetup\nfrom steppables import SteppableBasePy, Mitosis\n\nclass Simulation(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, _simulator, _num_cells):\n        SteppableBasePy.__init__(self, _simulator)\n        self.simulator = _simulator\n        self.num_cells = _num_cells\n        self.time = 0\n        self cell_type = 'Epithelial'\n        self cell_id = 0\n\n    def start(self):\n        self.simulator.setSimulationDimensions(10, 10, 1)\n        self.simulator.setFields(\"Cell\", \"Volume\", \"Surface\", \"Length\")\n        self.simulator.addSteppable(Mitosis())\n        self.createInitialCell()\n\n    def step(self, mcs):\n        self.time += 1\n        if mcs % 50 == 0:\n            self.divide_cells()\n\n    def createInitialCell(self):\n        cell = self.simulator.createCell(self.cell_type, self.cell_id)\n        cell.volume = 1\n        cell.surface = 1\n        cell.length = 1\n        self.simulator.addCellToSimulation(cell, [5, 5, 0])\n\n    def divide_cells(self):\n        for cell in self.simulator.cellList:\n            if cell.type == self.cell_type:\n                cell.divide()\n\nCompuCellSetup.simulator = Simulation(CompuCellSetup.simulator, 1)\nCompuCellSetup.simulator.run(100)\n```"
