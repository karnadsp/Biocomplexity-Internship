    "response": "<think>\nOkay, so the user wants me to generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file based on specific ontology annotations. They provided a Python code example that includes imports, a simulation class, and some basic setup. I need to make sure I follow their instructions precisely.\n\nFirst, I'll start by including the necessary imports. CompuCellSetup is essential for setting up the simulation, and SteppableBasePy from steppables will be needed for the simulation class. I'll import these at the top.\n\nNext, I need to create a simulation class that inherits from SteppableBasePy. This class should have __init__, start, and step methods. In the __init__ method, I'll set the number of cells, define the simulation dimensions, and specify the time parameters like the number of steps and interval.\n\nIn the start method, I'll initialize the cell field. I'll place a single Epithelial cell in the center of the simulation. This is a simple starting point, and I can add more cells later if needed.\n\nFor the step method, I'll include a basic cell division mechanism. Every 50 steps, each Epithelial cell will divide. I'll set the target volume for these cells to ensure they grow before dividing. This aligns with the ontology annotations related to cell division and proliferation.\n\nI also need to define the cell types and their parameters. The Epithelial cell type should have a nucleus, cytoplasm, and membrane. I'll set their respective volumes and surface areas. The metabolism and proliferation parameters are set to 1.0 to keep it simple, allowing cells to grow and divide without additional constraints.\n\nI'll make sure the code is clean and only includes the necessary parts without any extra explanations or text. The user specifically asked for only the Python code, so I'll avoid adding comments or other non-code elements.\n\nFinally, I'll review the code to ensure it's valid and follows CompuCell3D conventions. This includes proper indentation, correct method calls, and accurate parameter settings. Once everything looks good, I'll present the code as the answer.\n</think>\n\n```python\nfrom CompuCellSetup import *\nfrom steppables import SteppableBasePy\n\nclass Simulation(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, _simulator, _num_cells):\n        SteppableBasePy.__init__(self, _simulator)\n        self.num_cells = _num_cells\n        self.simulator = _simulator\n        self.simulator.setSimulationDimensions(50, 50, 1)\n        self.simulator.setSimulationTime(1000, 1)\n        \n    def start(self):\n        self.cell_field = self.simulator.getCellField()\n        self.cell_field.initialize()\n        self.create_cells()\n        \n    def step(self, mcs):\n        self.simulator.updateCellPositions()\n        if mcs % 50 == 0:\n            self.divide_cells()\n            \n    def create_cells(self):\n        cell = self.simulator.createCell(0, \"Epithelial\")\n        cell.volume = 10\n        cell.targetVolume = 10\n        cell.position = (25, 25, 0)\n        self.cell_field.addCell(cell)\n        \n    def divide_cells(self):\n        for cell in self.simulator.cellList:\n            if cell.type == \"Epithelial\":\n                cell.targetVolume *= 2\n                self.simulator.divideCell(cell, 0)\n                \ndef main():\n    simulator = CompuCell3D()\n    simulator.init()\n    simulator.addSteerable(Simulation, _num_cells=1)\n    simulator.run()\n    \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```"
