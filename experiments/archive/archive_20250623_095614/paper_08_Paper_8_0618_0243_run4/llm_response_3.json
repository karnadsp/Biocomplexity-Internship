    "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file based on the given ontology annotations. The user provided a Python code example, but I have to create my own version. Let me break down the requirements.\n\nFirst, the code must include the necessary imports. I remember that CompuCell3D uses modules like CompuCellSetup and steppables. So I'll import CompuCellSetup, which is essential for setting up the simulation. Then, I'll import the specific steppables, probably PySteppable from steppables.\n\nNext, I need to create a simulation class that inherits from SteppableBasePy. The example used SimulationClass, so I'll follow that structure. This class should have __init__, start, and step methods.\n\nIn the __init__ method, I'll call the parent class's __init__ to initialize everything properly. Then, I'll set up some parameters. The example used a string for cell_type and an integer for step. I'll do the same, maybe adding a parameter for cell cycle duration since the ontology mentions cell division and proliferation.\n\nThe start method is called once at the beginning. Here, I'll register a PyObserver to output data, like cell counts. I'll also set up a scheduler to run the step method every certain number of steps, say every 10 steps.\n\nIn the step method, I'll put logic specific to each step. For example, I can count the number of epithelial cells and print it. Since the ontology includes cell proliferation, I might add logic to increase cell numbers over time, but for simplicity, I'll just count and print.\n\nNow, setting up the simulation. I'll create an instance of CompuCellSetup.Simulator, set the simulation dimensions, and add the steppable class to it. Finally, I'll run the simulation with a certain number of steps.\n\nI should make sure the code is clean and only includes the necessary parts without any extra explanations. Also, I need to ensure that the code is properly indented and follows Python syntax.\n\nWait, in the example, the step method didn't have any specific logic beyond printing. Since the ontology includes cell division and proliferation, maybe I should include a simple growth mechanism, like increasing cell count each step. But to keep it simple, I'll just count and print the number of cells each time the step method is called.\n\nI think that's all. Now, I'll structure the code accordingly, making sure all required methods and imports are included.\n</think>\n\n```python\nfrom CompuCell3D import CompuCellSetup\nfrom steppables import PySteppable\n\nclass SimulationClass(PySteppable):\n    def __init__(self, _simulator, _cellType):\n        PySteppable.__init__(self, _simulator, _cellType)\n        self.simulator = _simulator\n        self.cellType = _cellType\n        self.step = 0\n        self.cell_type_string = \"Epithelial\"\n        self.cell_cycle_duration = 10  # Duration of cell cycle in simulation steps\n\n    def start(self):\n        self.step = 0\n        self.simulator.registerObserver(\"CellCountObserver\", \"CountCells\", {\"cellType\": self.cellType})\n        self.simulator.registerScheduler(self.schedulerCallback, 10)  # Schedule step method every 10 steps\n\n    def step(self):\n        self.step += 1\n        print(f\"Step: {self.step}, Number of Epithelial cells: {self.simulator.cellCount(self.cellType)}\")\n\ndef schedulerCallback(simulator, steppable):\n    steppable.step()\n\nsimulator = CompuCellSetup.Simulator()\nsimulator.setSimulationDimensions(50, 50, 1)\nsimulator.addSteppable(SimulationClass(simulator, \"Epithelial\"))\nsimulator.run(100)\n```"
