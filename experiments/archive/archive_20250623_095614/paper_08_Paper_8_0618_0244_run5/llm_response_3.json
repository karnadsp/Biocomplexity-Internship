    "response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file based on the provided ontology annotations. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the user has specified that the simulation should include certain ontologies: Epithelial cells, Cell Division, and Cell Proliferation. This suggests that the simulation will model the growth and division of epithelial cells.\n\nI'll start by considering the necessary imports. CompuCell3D requires importing CompuCellSetup and various steppables. So, I'll import CompuCellSetup, SteppableBasePy, MitosisSteppable, and VolumeConstraintSteppable. These are essential for setting up the simulation and handling cell behavior.\n\nNext, I'll create a simulation class that inherits from SteppableBasePy. This class will contain the __init__, start, and step methods. In the __init__ method, I'll initialize the parent class and set up the mitosis steppable, attaching it to the simulation. This will handle cell division.\n\nIn the start method, I'll read the simulation parameters, such as the number of cells and the mitosis distance. Then, I'll create a cell field and place a single epithelial cell in the middle of the simulation space. This initial cell will proliferate over time.\n\nFor the step method, I'll update a counter to track the number of divisions each cell has undergone. This will help in limiting the number of divisions to prevent excessive cell growth.\n\nI also need to define the simulation parameters. I'll set the simulation name, the number of cells to create, and the mitosis distance. These parameters control how the cells grow and divide.\n\nFinally, I'll ensure that the code is clean and only includes the necessary parts without any additional explanations or text, as per the user's request. This way, the code can be directly used in CompuCell3D without modifications.\n</think>\n\n```python\nfrom CompuCell3D import CompuCellSetup\nfrom steppables import SteppableBasePy, MitosisSteppable, VolumeConstraintSteppable\n\nclass Simulation(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, _simulator, _model):\n        SteppableBasePy.__init__(self, _simulator, _model)\n        self.simulator = _simulator\n        self.model = _model\n        self.mitosis_steppable = MitosisSteppable()\n        self.simulator.add_steppable(self.mitosis_steppable)\n        \n    def start(self):\n        self.simulator.read_parameters()\n        self.cell_field = self.simulator.cell_field\n        self.num_cells = self.simulator.get_parameter('num_cells')\n        self.mitosis_distance = self.simulator.get_parameter('mitosis_distance')\n        \n        # Create initial cell\n        cell = self.cell_field.new_cell(0)\n        cell.type = self.cell_field.get_type_id('Epithelial')\n        cell.position = [10, 10, 0]\n        \n    def step(self):\n        # Update cell division counter\n        for cell in self.cell_field.iterate():\n            if cell.type_id == self.cell_field.get_type_id('Epithelial'):\n                cell.attribute['division_count'] += 1\n                \ndef main():\n    # Read simulation parameters\n    simulator = CompuCellSetup.Simulator()\n    simulator.read_parameters('Simulation')\n    \n    # Set simulation parameters\n    simulator.set_num_iterations(1000)\n    simulator.set_output_directory('output')\n    \n    # Register cell types\n    simulator.register_cell_type('Epithelial')\n    \n    # Create simulation instance\n    simulation = Simulation(simulator)\n    \n    # Run simulation\n    simulator.run()\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```"
