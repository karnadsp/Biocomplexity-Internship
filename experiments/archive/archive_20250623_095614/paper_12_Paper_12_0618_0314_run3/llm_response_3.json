    "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file based on the given ontology annotations. The user provided a Python code example, but I should create my own. Let me break down the requirements.\n\nFirst, the code must include the necessary imports. I'll need to import CompuCellSetup and steppables. Also, since the simulation uses an SBML model, I should import SBMLTypes from PySBML.\n\nNext, I need to define a simulation class that inherits from SteppableBasePy. This class should have __init__, start, and step methods. In the __init__, I'll set the simulation name and duration. The start method will initialize cell types and load the SBML model. The step method will handle cell division logic.\n\nLooking at the ontology annotations, the cell type is Epithelial (CL:0000000), and the processes are Cell Division (GO:0000000) and Cell Proliferation (D000000). So, I'll create an Epithelial cell type and set its parameters like proliferation and division.\n\nI'll define a cell cycle model where cells grow until they reach a certain size, then divide. The SBML model will handle the cell cycle dynamics. I'll set parameters like initial volume, growth rate, division volume, and duration.\n\nIn the simulation, I'll create a single Epithelial cell at the center. The SBML model will be loaded, and each cell will have a cell cycle SBML solver. During each step, I'll check if the cell's volume exceeds the division threshold and trigger division if so.\n\nI'll also set up the simulation module to run for a specified number of steps, output a checkpoint, and use the GGHMC algorithm for cell movement.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll structure the code with the necessary imports, the simulation class with the required methods, and the main function to run the simulation.\n</think>\n\n```python\nfrom CompuCell3D import CompuCellSetup, Simulation\nfrom steppables import SteppableBasePy\nfrom PySBML import SBMLTypes\n\nclass SimulationClass(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, _simulator, _simulation_name):\n        super(SimulationClass, self).__init__(_simulator, _simulation_name)\n        self.simulator = _simulator\n        self.simulation_name = _simulation_name\n        self.simulation_duration = 1000  # Simulation duration in Monte Carlo steps\n        \n    def start(self):\n        # Initialize cell types and parameters\n        self.cell_type = self.simulator.get_cell_type_plugin()\n        self.cell_type.type_name = 'Epithelial'\n        self.cell_type.description = 'Epithelial cell type'\n        \n        # Load SBML model for cell cycle regulation\n        self.sbml_model = self.simulator.get_sbml_model()\n        self.sbml_model.load_SBML_model('cell_cycle.sbml')\n        \n        # Set initial cell properties\n        self.initial_cell = self.simulator.cell_field.get_new_cell(self.cell_type)\n        self.initial_cell.volume = 10.0\n        self.initial_cell.position = [50, 50, 0]\n        self.simulator.cell_field.add_cell(self.initial_cell)\n        \n    def step(self, mcs):\n        # Check if cell should divide based on cell cycle model\n        if mcs > 100 and mcs % 100 == 0:\n            for cell in self.simulator.cell_field.iterate():\n                if cell.type == self.cell_type and cell.volume > 20.0:\n                    self.simulator.divide_cell(cell)\n                    \n    def finish(self):\n        pass\n\ndef main():\n    # Create simulation\n    sim = Simulation()\n    sim.simulation_name = 'EpithelialProliferation'\n    sim.simulation_duration = 1000\n    \n    # Register steppables\n    sim.register_steppable(SimulationClass(sim))\n    \n    # Add cell types\n    sim.cell_types = ['Epithelial']\n    \n    # Set simulation parameters\n    sim.output_directory = './output'\n    sim.checkpoint_save_interval = 100\n    sim.get_potts_solver().set_number_of_iterations(100)\n    sim.get_potts_solver().set_fluctuation_sweep(0.1)\n    \n    # Run simulation\n    sim.run()\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```"
