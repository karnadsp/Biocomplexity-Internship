    "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a valid CompuCell3D simulation file based on the given ontology annotations. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the user provided specific ontology terms: Epithelial cell, Regulation of cell proliferation, Cell division, and Cell proliferation. So, the simulation should model epithelial cell behavior focusing on proliferation and division.\n\nI'll start by importing the necessary modules. I know CompuCell3D requires importing CompuCellSetup and various steppables, so I'll include those.\n\nNext, I need a simulation class that inherits from SteppableBasePy. This class will have __init__, start, and step methods. In the __init__, I'll set the simulation name and duration. The start method will initialize the cell field with epithelial cells, and the step method will handle cell proliferation and division logic.\n\nFor cell types, I'll define 'Epithelial' as the main type. The parameters should include cell proliferation and division rates. I'll set a fixed number of cells to simulate, say 100, to keep it simple.\n\nIn the start method, I'll create a cell field where each pixel is an epithelial cell. This initializes the simulation with a layer of these cells.\n\nIn the step method, I'll calculate the number of cells at each step and print it. Then, I'll check if the cell count exceeds a threshold (like 500) to stop the simulation. For each cell, I'll apply a proliferation rate to determine if it divides. If so, I'll use a mitosis steppable to handle cell division.\n\nI'll also set up the simulation to run for a certain number of steps and use a basic solver for the fields.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll structure the code with the necessary imports, the simulation class with the required methods, and the setup function to initialize and run the simulation.\n</think>\n\n```python\nfrom CompuCellSetup import Simulator\nfrom steppables import *\nfrom steppables import MitosisSteppable\nimport numpy as np\n\nclass EpithelialCellSimulation(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, _simulator, _frequency=1):\n        super(EpithelialCellSimulation, self).__init__(_simulator, _frequency)\n        self.simulator = _simulator\n        self.name = \"Epithelial Cell Simulation\"\n        self.duration = 1000  # Total simulation steps\n        self.cell_proliferation_rate = 0.01  # Proliferation rate per cell\n        self.cell_division_rate = 0.005  # Division rate per cell\n\n    def start(self):\n        # Initialize cell field with epithelial cells\n        cell_type = self.simulator.get_cell_type_plugin()\n        cell_type.type_name = \"Epithelial\"\n        cell_type.description = \"Epithelial cell (CL:0000066)\"\n        self.simulator.cell_type_plugins.append(cell_type)\n        \n        # Create initial cell configuration\n        self.simulator.create_cell_field()\n        for x in range(self.simulator.x_dim):\n            for y in range(self.simulator.y_dim):\n                for z in range(self.simulator.z_dim):\n                    self.simulator.cell_field[x, y, z] = cell_type\n\n    def step(self, mcs):\n        # Get current cell count\n        cell_count = self.simulator.cell_field.size\n        print(f\"Step {mcs}: {cell_count} cells\")\n        \n        # Check if simulation should stop\n        if mcs >= self.duration:\n            self.simulator.stop_simulation()\n            \n        # Apply cell proliferation and division logic\n        if cell_count < 500:  # Stop proliferation when reaching 500 cells\n            proliferation_rate = self.cell_proliferation_rate\n            division_rate = self.cell_division_rate\n            for cell in self.simulator.cell_list:\n                if np.random.rand() < proliferation_rate:\n                    # Apply proliferation\n                    pass\n                if np.random.rand() < division_rate:\n                    # Apply division\n                    mitosis_steppable = MitosisSteppable(simulator=self.simulator)\n                    mitosis_steppable.start()\n                    mitosis_steppable.step(mcs)\n                    mitosis_steppable.finish()\n\ndef setup_simulator():\n    simulator = Simulator()\n    simulator.simulation_dims = (100, 100, 1)  # x, y, z dimensions\n    simulator.simulation_time = 1000  # Total simulation steps\n    simulator.save_output_frequency = 10  # Save data every 10 steps\n    simulator.load_objects(\"CompuCellPythonSetup.py\")\n    return simulator\n\nsimulator = setup_simulator()\nsimulator.add_steppable(EpithelialCellSimulation(simulator, 1))\nsimulator.run()\n```"
