    "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to create a JSON object with ontology annotations based on the provided information. The user has given me an example and specific formatting rules. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand the structure required. The JSON should have three categories: \"CellOntology\", \"GeneOntology\", and \"MeSH\". Each category is an array of objects, each containing an \"id\" and a \"term\".\n\nLooking at the example, the IDs are in the format \"CL:0000000\" for Cell Ontology, \"GO:0000000\" for Gene Ontology, and \"D000000\" for MeSH. The terms are also specific, like \"Epithelial\" or \"Cell Division\".\n\nNow, considering the original description provided by the user, it seems like they want me to extract relevant terms from their text and map them to the appropriate ontologies. However, in this case, the user hasn't provided a specific description, just the clarification. So I might need to assume some terms or perhaps the example is sufficient.\n\nWait, the user's original message says: \"Return ONLY a JSON object with categories for different ontology types.\" So maybe they just want me to structure it correctly without any additional information.\n\nI should ensure that the category names are exact: \"CellOntology\", \"GeneOntology\", and \"MeSH\". No extra spaces or different capitalization.\n\nEach entry in the arrays should have \"id\" and \"term\" keys. The IDs must not have spaces, and the terms should be exact without any extra spaces.\n\nSince the user didn't provide specific terms, I'll use the example they gave. In the example, there's an Epithelial cell in CellOntology, Cell Division in GeneOntology, and Cell Proliferation in MeSH.\n\nSo, I'll structure the JSON accordingly, making sure the IDs and terms match exactly as per the example.\n\nI should also remember not to include any explanations or thinking process, just the JSON object.\n\nLet me double-check the formatting. The keys are in quotes, the values are in quotes where necessary, and the structure is correct with commas separating the objects.\n\nI think that's all. Now, I'll prepare the JSON as per the example, ensuring all the formatting rules are followed.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000000\",\n            \"term\": \"Epithelial\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0000000\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Division\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D000000\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Proliferation\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```"
