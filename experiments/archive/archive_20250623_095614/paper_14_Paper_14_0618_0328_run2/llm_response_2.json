    "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to create a structured ontology annotation based on the provided information. The user has given me a specific format to follow, which includes CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH terms. They also provided an example, so I should stick to that structure.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the original description. It seems like the example given includes terms like \"Epithelial\", \"Cell Division\", and \"Cell Proliferation\". I need to map these to their respective ontology IDs.\n\nFor CellOntology, \"Epithelial\" corresponds to CL:0000066. I remember that CL stands for Cell Ontology, so that's correct. Next, for GeneOntology, \"Cell Division\" is GO:0051781. I think that's right because I've seen that ID before in similar contexts. Lastly, MeSH uses D terms, so \"Cell Proliferation\" is D001327. I should double-check that to make sure it's accurate.\n\nI need to ensure that the JSON structure is correct. Each category should be an array of objects with \"id\" and \"term\" keys. Also, the category names must be exact as specified: \"CellOntology\", \"GeneOntology\", and \"MeSH\".\n\nI should avoid adding any extra spaces in the IDs or terms. So, no spaces after colons or between numbers. Also, the terms should be exact without any typos.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with each ontology as a key and the corresponding array of objects. I'll make sure there are no explanations or additional text, just the JSON.\n\nI think that's all. I'll format it correctly and ensure it's valid JSON.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000066\",\n            \"term\": \"Epithelial\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0051781\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Division\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D001327\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Proliferation\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```"
