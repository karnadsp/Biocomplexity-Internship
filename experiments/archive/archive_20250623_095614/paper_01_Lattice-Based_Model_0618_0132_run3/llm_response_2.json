    "prompt": "Original description: Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a heterogeneous group of non-invasive lesions of the breast that result from abnormal proliferation of mammary epithelial cells. Pathologists characterize DCIS by four tissue morphologies (micropapillary, cribriform, solid, and comedo), but the underlying mechanisms that distinguish the development and progression of these morphologies are not well understood. Here we explored the conditions leading to the emergence of the different morphologies of DCIS using a two-dimensional multi-cell lattice-based model that incorporates cell proliferation, apoptosis, necrosis, adhesion, and contractility. We found that the relative rates of cell proliferation and apoptosis governed which of the four morphologies emerged. High proliferation and low apoptosis favored the emergence of solid and comedo morphologies. In contrast, low proliferation and high apoptosis led to the micropapillary morphology, whereas high proliferation and high apoptosis led to the cribriform morphology. The natural progression between morphologies cannot be investigated in vivo since lesions are usually surgically removed upon detection; however, our model suggests probable transitions between these morphologies during breast cancer progression. Importantly, cribriform and comedo appear to be the ultimate morphologies of DCIS. Motivated by previous experimental studies demonstrating that tumor cells behave differently depending on where they are located within the mammary duct in vivo or in engineered tissues, we examined the effects of tissue geometry on the progression of DCIS. In agreement with our previous experimental work, we found that cells are more likely to invade from the end of ducts and that this preferential invasion is regulated by cell adhesion and contractility. This model provides additional insight into tumor cell behavior and allows the exploration of phenotypic transitions not easily monitored in vivo.\n\nClarifications provided: \n\n\n    Return ONLY a JSON object with ontology annotations.

    "response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to create a JSON object with ontology annotations based on the provided description of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The user has specified that I should use Cell Ontology, Gene Ontology (GO), and MeSH terms where applicable. \n\nFirst, I'll read through the description carefully to identify key biological concepts. The text mentions mammary epithelial cells, which directly points to the Cell Ontology. I'll look up the exact term and ID for mammary epithelial cells in the Cell Ontology database. \n\nNext, the description talks about processes like cell proliferation, apoptosis, necrosis, adhesion, and contractility. These are all biological processes, so I'll map them to the appropriate GO terms. For example, cell proliferation is a well-known GO term, and I'll find its exact ID.\n\nThe text also discusses tissue morphologies such as micropapillary, cribriform, solid, and comedo. These are specific types related to breast neoplasms, so I'll check MeSH for the correct terms and IDs. \n\nAdditionally, the model explores tumor cell invasion and behavior within mammary ducts, which relates to neoplasm invasiveness in MeSH. I'll include that term as well.\n\nI need to ensure that all IDs and terms are exact, without any extra spaces. For example, \"CL:0000060\" for mammary epithelial cells, and \"GO:0008283\" for cell proliferation. Each entry should be correctly formatted under their respective ontology categories.\n\nI'll structure the JSON with three main categories: CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH. Each category will have an array of objects containing \"id\" and \"term\" pairs. I'll double-check each term and ID to make sure they're accurate and properly formatted according to the user's instructions.\n\nFinally, I'll compile all the identified terms into the JSON structure, ensuring there are no explanations or additional text\u2014just the JSON object as requested.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000060\",\n            \"term\": \"Mammary epithelial cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0008283\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell proliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0008635\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell death\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0098602\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0035988\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell contraction\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D001932\",\n            \"term\": \"Breast Neoplasms\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D019867\",\n            \"term\": \"Carcinoma, Ductal\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D019867\",\n            \"term\": \"Carcinoma, Ductal, in situ\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D015649\",\n            \"term\": \"Tumor Cells\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D015648\",\n            \"term\": \"Tumor Progression\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D015651\",\n            \"term\": \"Neoplasm Invasiveness\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```"
