    "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file based on the given ontology annotations. The user provided a Python code example, but I have to create my own. Let me break down the requirements.\n\nFirst, the code must include the necessary imports. I remember that CompuCell3D uses modules like CompuCellSetup and steppables. So I'll import CompuCellSetup, which is essential for setting up the simulation. Then, I'll import the specific steppables, probably SteppableBasePy from steppables, since the simulation class should inherit from it.\n\nNext, I need a simulation class that inherits from SteppableBasePy. The class should have __init__, start, and step methods. In the __init__ method, I'll call the parent class's __init__ to initialize properly. I'll also set some parameters here, like the number of cells to create, which I'll get from the user's example.\n\nThe start method is where I'll set up the initial cell. Using the cellField, I'll create a cell at a specific position, say (10,10), and assign it the cell type from the ontology, which is 'Epithelial'. I'll also set the diameter of the cell to make it visible.\n\nIn the step method, I'll put logic that happens every simulation step. Since the ontology mentions cell division and proliferation, I'll make the cell divide when it's large enough. I'll check if the cell's volume is greater than a certain threshold, say 100, and then call cell.divide(). This will simulate cell division.\n\nI also need to include the basic cell types and parameters based on the ontology. The cell type is 'Epithelial', so I'll ensure that's correctly assigned. The parameters like cell diameter and division volume should be set to realistic values for the simulation.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll structure the code with the imports at the top, followed by the simulation class with the required methods. I'll make sure the code is clean and only includes what's necessary without any extra explanations.\n\nI should test this code in my mind. When the simulation runs, it should create an epithelial cell that grows and divides once it reaches a certain size. This aligns with the ontology terms provided, focusing on cell division and proliferation.\n\nI think that's all. Now, I'll write the code accordingly, ensuring it meets all the specified requirements.\n</think>\n\n```python\nfrom CompuCell3D import CompuCellSetup\nfrom steppables import SteppableBasePy\n\nclass Simulation(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, _simulator, _num_cells):\n        SteppableBasePy.__init__(self, _simulator)\n        self.num_cells = _num_cells\n        self.cell_type = 'Epithelial'\n        self cell_diameter = 2.0\n\n    def start(self):\n        cell = self.cell_field.new_cell(self.cell_type)\n        cell.position = (10, 10)\n        cell.volume = 1\n        cell.diameter = self.cell_diameter\n\n    def step(self, mcs):\n        if mcs == 100:\n            cell = self.cell_field.get_cell_at_position((10, 10))\n            if cell.volume > 100:\n                cell.divide()\n```"
