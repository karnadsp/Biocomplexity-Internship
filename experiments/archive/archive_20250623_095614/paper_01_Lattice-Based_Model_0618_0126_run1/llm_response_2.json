    "prompt": "Original description: Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a heterogeneous group of non-invasive lesions of the breast that result from abnormal proliferation of mammary epithelial cells. Pathologists characterize DCIS by four tissue morphologies (micropapillary, cribriform, solid, and comedo), but the underlying mechanisms that distinguish the development and progression of these morphologies are not well understood. Here we explored the conditions leading to the emergence of the different morphologies of DCIS using a two-dimensional multi-cell lattice-based model that incorporates cell proliferation, apoptosis, necrosis, adhesion, and contractility. We found that the relative rates of cell proliferation and apoptosis governed which of the four morphologies emerged. High proliferation and low apoptosis favored the emergence of solid and comedo morphologies. In contrast, low proliferation and high apoptosis led to the micropapillary morphology, whereas high proliferation and high apoptosis led to the cribriform morphology. The natural progression between morphologies cannot be investigated in vivo since lesions are usually surgically removed upon detection; however, our model suggests probable transitions between these morphologies during breast cancer progression. Importantly, cribriform and comedo appear to be the ultimate morphologies of DCIS. Motivated by previous experimental studies demonstrating that tumor cells behave differently depending on where they are located within the mammary duct in vivo or in engineered tissues, we examined the effects of tissue geometry on the progression of DCIS. In agreement with our previous experimental work, we found that cells are more likely to invade from the end of ducts and that this preferential invasion is regulated by cell adhesion and contractility. This model provides additional insight into tumor cell behavior and allows the exploration of phenotypic transitions not easily monitored in vivo.\n\nClarifications provided: \n\n\n    Return ONLY a JSON object with ontology annotations.

    "response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to create a structured ontology annotation based on the provided information about ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The user wants me to include relevant terms from Cell Ontology, Gene Ontology (GO), and MeSH. I should return only a JSON object with the specified categories.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the original description to identify key biological concepts. DCIS is a non-invasive breast lesion involving abnormal proliferation of mammary epithelial cells. The description mentions cell proliferation, apoptosis, necrosis, adhesion, contractility, and tissue geometry. It also talks about different morphologies: micropapillary, cribriform, solid, and comedo.\n\nStarting with Cell Ontology, the term \"Epithelial\" is relevant since DCIS involves epithelial cells. The ID for Epithelial in Cell Ontology is CL:0000057.\n\nNext, for Gene Ontology, the processes mentioned are cell proliferation (GO:0008283), apoptosis (GO:0008635), and cell adhesion (GO:0007155). These are all key biological processes discussed in the text.\n\nLooking at MeSH terms, \"Ductal Carcinoma In Situ\" (D005728) is directly relevant. \"Breast Neoplasms\" (D001943) is also applicable since DCIS is a type of breast lesion. \"Cell Proliferation\" (D002205) is another important term as it's a central process in the description.\n\nI need to ensure that the JSON structure follows the exact category names: \"CellOntology\", \"GeneOntology\", and \"MeSH\". Each entry should have an \"id\" and \"term\" with exact strings and correct formatting without extra spaces.\n\nI'll compile these terms into the JSON structure, making sure each ID and term is correctly formatted as per the user's instructions. No explanations or additional text should be included, just the JSON object.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000057\",\n            \"term\": \"Epithelial\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0008283\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Proliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0008635\",\n            \"term\": \"Apoptosis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007155\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Adhesion\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D005728\",\n            \"term\": \"Ductal Carcinoma In Situ\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D001943\",\n            \"term\": \"Breast Neoplasms\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002205\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Proliferation\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```"
