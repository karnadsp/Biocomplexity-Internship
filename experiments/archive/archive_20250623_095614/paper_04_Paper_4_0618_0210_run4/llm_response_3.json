    "response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file based on the given ontology annotations. Let me break down the requirements and figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the user provided an example response, which I can use as a reference. The code includes imports, a simulation class, and specific methods. The ontology terms are Epithelial cells, Cell Division, and Cell Proliferation.\n\nI should start by including the necessary imports. The example uses CompuCellSetup and steppables, so I'll import those. Next, I need to create a simulation class that inherits from SteppableBasePy. This class should have __init__, start, and step methods.\n\nIn the __init__ method, I'll set the simulation name and duration. The start method initializes the simulation, so I'll add a 3D lattice and set the time units. For cell behavior, I'll create a cell type for Epithelial cells and set their proliferation parameters, like division and apoptosis rates.\n\nThe step method will handle cell division and apoptosis. I'll use a loop to process each cell, checking if they should divide or die based on the probabilities set. I'll also output the simulation progress to the console.\n\nI need to ensure that the code is clean and only includes the necessary parts without any extra text. I'll structure it according to the example, making sure all required methods are present and functional.\n\nFinally, I'll test the code in my mind to see if it logically follows the steps: initializing the simulation, setting up cell behaviors, and handling each time step correctly. This should result in a valid simulation file that meets the user's specifications.\n</think>\n\n```python\nfrom CompuCellSetup import Simulator\nfrom steppables import SteppableBasePy\n\nclass Simulation(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, _simulator, _frequency=1):\n        SteppableBasePy.__init__(self, _simulator, _frequency)\n        self.simulator = _simulator\n        self.simulation_name = \"EpithelialCellProliferation\"\n        self.simulation_duration = 1000  # Simulation duration in Monte Carlo steps\n\n    def start(self):\n        # Initialize simulation\n        self.simulator.initialize()\n        # Create 3D lattice\n        self.simulator.createLattice(10, 10, 10, 1, 1, 1)\n        # Set time units\n        self.simulator.setTimeUnit(1, 1)\n        # Add cell type\n        self.cellType = self.simulator.registerCellType(\"Epithelial\", \"CL:0000000\")\n        # Set cell proliferation parameters\n        self.cellProliferationParameters = {\n            'cellDivisionRate': 0.01,\n            'apoptosisRate': 0.005\n        }\n\n    def step(self, mcs):\n        # Handle cell division\n        for cell in self.simulator.cellList:\n            if cell.type == self.cellType:\n                if self.randomNumber() < self.cellProliferationParameters['cellDivisionRate']:\n                    self.simulator.divideCellRandomOrientation(cell)\n                if self.randomNumber() < self.cellProliferationParameters['apoptosisRate']:\n                    self.simulator.deleteCell(cell)\n        # Output simulation progress\n        print(f\"Simulation step: {mcs}\")\n\n# Create simulation instance\nsim = Simulator()\nsim.addSteppable(Simulation(sim))\nsim.run(1000)\n```"
