    "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file based on the given ontology annotations. The user provided a Python code example, but I have to create my own. Let me break down the requirements.\n\nFirst, the code must include the necessary imports. I remember that CompuCell3D uses modules like CompuCellSetup and steppables. So I'll import CompuCellSetup, which is necessary for setting up the simulation. Then, I'll import the specific steppables, like PySteppable, which is needed for creating custom logic.\n\nNext, I need a simulation class that inherits from SteppableBasePy. The example used Simulation class, so I'll follow that structure. This class should have __init__, start, and step methods. In the __init__ method, I'll set the frequency to 100, meaning the step method runs every 100 simulation steps.\n\nIn the start method, I'll initialize the cell field. Using fieldsecret.get_potts_field(), I can create a field for the cells. Then, I'll add a cell of type Epithelial at a specific position, say (10,10,0), with a volume of 100. This sets up the initial cell in the simulation.\n\nFor the step method, I'll add a simple print statement to indicate that a step has been taken. This helps in tracking the simulation's progress.\n\nThe ontology annotations mention Epithelial cells, Cell Division, and Cell Proliferation. So, I'll include parameters related to cell division and proliferation. I'll set cell_division_rate to 0.01 and cell_proliferation_rate to 0.005. These parameters can be used in more complex logic later, like cell growth or division.\n\nI also need to include basic cell types and parameters. The example used Epithelial cells, so I'll define the cell_type and cell_name accordingly. This helps in identifying the cell type during the simulation.\n\nFinally, I'll create an instance of the simulation class and set it using CompuCellSetup.setSimulation(). This ensures that the simulation runs with the specified parameters and logic.\n\nI should make sure the code is clean and only includes the necessary parts without any extra text. I'll avoid adding explanations or print statements beyond what's needed for functionality.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll structure the code with the imports at the top, followed by the Simulation class with the required methods, and then the instance creation. This should result in a valid CompuCell3D simulation file that meets the user's specifications.\n</think>\n\n```python\nfrom CompuCell3D import CompuCellSetup\nfrom steppables import PySteppable\n\nclass Simulation(PySteppable):\n    def __init__(self, _simulator, _frequency=100):\n        PySteppable.__init__(self, _simulator, _frequency)\n        self.simulator = _simulator\n        self.frequency = _frequency\n\n    def start(self):\n        self.simulator.get_potts_field().initialize_cell_type/plugins/CellType/Epithelial\n        self.cell = self.simulator.cell_field.add_cell(10, 10, 0, \"Epithelial\")\n        self.cell.volume = 100\n\n    def step(self, mcs):\n        print(f\"Simulation step: {mcs}\")\n\n# Define cell types and parameters\ncell_type = \"Epithelial\"\ncell_parameters = {\n    \"cell_division_rate\": 0.01,\n    \"cell_proliferation_rate\": 0.005\n}\n\n# Create simulation instance\nsim = Simulation(None)\nCompuCellSetup.setSimulation(sim)\n```"
