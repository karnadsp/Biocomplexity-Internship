    "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file based on the given ontology annotations. The user provided a Python code example, but I have to think through how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the ontology terms: Epithelial cells, Cell Division, and Cell Proliferation. So the simulation should model epithelial cell proliferation, which likely involves cell division.\n\nI remember that in CompuCell3D, cell behavior is often controlled by steppables. So I'll need to create a steppable that handles cell division.\n\nThe user's example uses MitosisSteppable, which is part of CompuCell3D. This steppable handles cell division, so it's appropriate here. I'll import it from steppables.\n\nNext, I'll set up the simulation class. It should inherit from SteppableBasePy. In the __init__ method, I'll call the parent's initializer and add the MitosisSteppable with a frequency, say 100, which means it runs every 100 simulation steps.\n\nIn the start method, I'll set the simulation duration, maybe 1000 steps, so the simulation runs long enough to see cell divisions.\n\nFor the step method, since cell division is handled by the MitosisSteppable, I might not need to add extra logic here unless I want to track something specific each step, but for now, I'll leave it as is.\n\nI also need to ensure that the cell types are correctly defined. The example uses 'Epithelial' as the default cell type, which aligns with the ontology. I'll make sure that in the code, the default cell type is set to 'Epithelial'.\n\nI should check if there are any specific parameters needed for cell proliferation. The MitosisSteppable might require parameters like division_rate or target_volume, but in the example, these aren't set. Maybe they're handled elsewhere or use default values.\n\nI'll structure the code with the necessary imports, define the simulation class with the required methods, and include the MitosisSteppable to manage cell division.\n\nFinally, I'll make sure the code is clean and only includes the Python code as per the user's request, without any extra explanations or text.\n</think>\n\n```python\nfrom CompuCell3D import *\nfrom steppables import *\n\nclass EpithelialProliferationSimulation(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, _simulator, _frequency=1):\n        SteppableBasePy.__init__(self, _simulator, _frequency)\n        self.simulator = _simulator\n        self MitosisSteppable = MitosisSteppable(self.simulator, 100)\n        self.simulator.add_steppable(self.MitosisSteppable)\n        \n    def start(self):\n        self.simulator.run(1000)\n        \n    def step(self, mcs):\n        pass\n\ndef main():\n    simulator = Simulator()\n    simulator.add_steppable(EpithelialProliferationSimulation(simulator, 1))\n    simulator.run()\n    \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```"
