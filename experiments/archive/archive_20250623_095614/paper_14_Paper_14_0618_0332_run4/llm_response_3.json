    "response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file based on the provided ontology annotations. Let me break down the requirements and figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the user specified that the code must include certain elements: imports, a simulation class inheriting from SteppableBasePy, and specific methods like __init__, start, and step. Also, the cell types and parameters should be based on the given ontology terms.\n\nLooking at the ontology annotations, I see 'Epithelial' cells, 'Cell Division', and 'Cell Proliferation'. So, the simulation should model epithelial cell proliferation, which likely involves cell division.\n\nI'll start by importing the necessary modules. I know CompuCell3D uses the CompuCellSetup module, and steppables are needed for the simulation logic. So, I'll import CompuCellSetup and the relevant steppables.\n\nNext, I'll create a simulation class called EpithelialProliferationSimulation that inherits from SteppableBasePy. This class will handle the simulation's initialization, setup, and each time step.\n\nIn the __init__ method, I'll call the parent class's initializer to set up the basic structure. Then, in the start method, I'll set up the simulation by creating a 3D lattice and adding a single epithelial cell in the middle. This cell will be of type Epithelial, which I'll define with specific parameters like volume, surface area, and proliferation-related attributes.\n\nFor the cell cycle, I'll set the initial phase to G1 and set a fixed duration for each phase. This simplifies the model, ensuring each cell divides after a set period. I'll also set a target volume to simulate cell growth before division.\n\nIn the step method, I'll handle cell division. Each time step, I'll check every cell. If a cell's volume exceeds its target volume, it will divide. I'll use the built-in divide_cell function, specifying a random axis to simulate division in any direction.\n\nAdditionally, I'll set up a basic visualization using Mayavi to display the simulation in 3D. This involves creating a scene, adding a cell outline module, and an OpenGL renderer.\n\nI'll also include a main function to run the simulation, setting the simulation name, number of steps, and output frequency for saving data.\n\nThroughout this process, I need to ensure that all parameters are correctly initialized and that the logic for cell division is accurately implemented based on the ontology terms provided. I'll make sure the code is clean, well-structured, and adheres to CompuCell3D's conventions.\n</think>\n\n```python\nfrom CompuCell3D import CompuCellSetup\nfrom steppables import SteppableBasePy, Model\nimport os\n\nclass EpithelialProliferationSimulation(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, _simulator, _model):\n        SteppableBasePy.__init__(self, _simulator, _model)\n        self.simulator = _simulator\n        self.model = _model\n        \n    def start(self):\n        # Initialize simulation\n        self.simulator.getSimulationThread().steppingOutputFrequency = 100\n        self.simulator.getSimulationThread().outputDirectory = './output'\n        \n        # Create a 3D lattice\n        self.simulator.createEmptyLattice(50, 50, 50, 1, 1, 1)\n        \n        # Add a single epithelial cell in the middle\n        cell = self.simulator.createCell()\n        cell.type = self.simulator.cellTypePluginManager.getPlugin(\"Epithelial\")\n        cell.volume = 1\n        cell.surfaceArea = 1\n        cell.position = (25, 25, 25)\n        self.simulator.addCellToSimulation(cell)\n        \n        # Set up cell cycle model\n        cell_cycle = self.simulator.getPlugin(\"UniformCellCycle\")\n        cell_cycle.duration = 100\n        cell_cycle.initializeCellCycleModel(cell)\n        \n        # Set cell proliferation parameters\n        cell.proliferation = 1.0\n        cell.targetVolume = 2.0\n        \n    def step(self, mcs):\n        # Check if any cell should divide\n        for cell in self.simulator.cellList:\n            if cell.volume > cell.targetVolume:\n                self.simulator.divideCellRandomly(cell)\n                \n    def finish(self):\n        pass\n\ndef main():\n    # Create simulation\n    sim = CompuCellSetup.Simulator()\n    model = Model()\n    \n    # Register cell types\n    model.registerCellType(\"Epithelial\", \"Epithelial\")\n    \n    # Add steppable\n    sim.addSteppable(EpithelialProliferationSimulation(sim, model))\n    \n    # Run simulation\n    sim.run(1000)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```"
