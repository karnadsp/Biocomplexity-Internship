    "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file based on the given ontology annotations. The user provided a Python code example, but I have to create my own. Let me break down the requirements.\n\nFirst, the code must include the necessary imports. I remember that CompuCell3D uses modules like CompuCellSetup and steppables. So I'll import CompuCellSetup, which is essential for setting up the simulation. Then, I'll import the specific steppables needed, like PySteppableBase from steppables, which is required for creating custom steppables.\n\nNext, I need to define a simulation class that inherits from SteppableBasePy. This class should have the __init__, start, and step methods. In the __init__ method, I'll initialize the parent class and set up any parameters specific to this simulation. For example, I might track cell count or division time.\n\nLooking at the ontology annotations, the simulation involves cell division, proliferation, and somatic cells. So I'll focus on parameters related to cell division. I'll include parameters like cell_division_time, which determines how often cells divide, and cell_proliferation_rate, which affects how quickly the cell population grows.\n\nIn the start method, I'll initialize the cell count and set up any visualizations or output options. For instance, I might output the simulation time and cell count at each step. This helps in tracking how the cell population changes over time.\n\nThe step method is where the actual simulation logic happens. Here, I'll check if the current time exceeds the cell division time. If it does, I'll trigger cell division for all cells. This involves iterating over each cell and calling the divide() method on them. After each division event, I'll reset the timer and print out the current time and cell count.\n\nI also need to define the simulation parameters. This includes setting the simulation name, time and space units, and the duration of the simulation. The time step should be smaller than the cell division time to ensure accurate simulation. I'll set the total number of steps to cover the entire simulation duration.\n\nFor the visualization, I'll use the built-in CompuCell3D viewer with a basic layout. This will display the cells as they proliferate and divide over time.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll structure the code with the necessary imports, the simulation class with the required methods, and the setup function that initializes and runs the simulation. I'll make sure to include comments where necessary to explain each part, but since the user wants only the code, I'll keep it clean without extra text.\n\nI should also ensure that the code is properly indented and follows Python syntax. The parameters are initialized correctly, and the logic for cell division is sound. Testing the code would involve running it in CompuCell3D and observing if cells divide and proliferate as expected.\n\nFinally, I'll review the code to make sure it meets all the user's requirements: correct imports, proper class structure, necessary methods, and inclusion of parameters based on the ontology terms provided.\n</think>\n\n```python\nfrom CompuCell3D import CompuCellSetup\nfrom steppables import PySteppableBase\n\nclass CellProliferationSimulation(PySteppableBase):\n    def __init__(self, _simulator, _frequency=1):\n        PySteppableBase.__init__(self, _simulator, _frequency)\n        self.simulator = _simulator\n        self.cell_count = 0\n        self.cell_division_time = 10.0  # Time between cell divisions\n        self.cell_proliferation_rate = 0.1  # Proliferation rate\n\n    def start(self):\n        self.cell_count = len(self.simulator.cellList)\n        print(\"Initial cell count:\", self.cell_count)\n\n    def step(self, mcs):\n        if mcs >= self.cell_division_time:\n            self.cell_count = len(self.simulator.cellList)\n            print(f\"Time: {mcs}, Cell count: {self.cell_count}\")\n            self.cell_division_time += 10.0\n\ndef setup(simulation_name=\"CellProliferation\"):\n    # Create instance of CompuCell3D simulator\n    sim = CompuCellSetup.Simulator()\n    \n    # Set simulation parameters\n    sim.simulation_name = simulation_name\n    sim.simulation_time = 100.0\n    sim.time_unit = \"hour\"\n    sim.space_unit = \"cell_diameter\"\n    sim.length_unit = \"micrometer\"\n    \n    # Add steppable\n    sim.add_steppable(CellProliferationSimulation(sim, 1))\n    \n    # Set numerical solvers\n    sim.setNumericalMethod(\"ODE\", \"LSODA\")\n    sim.setSolver(\"Cell\", \"DiffusionSolver3D\")\n    \n    # Set output\n    sim.output = CompuCellSetup.Output()\n    sim.output.output_frequency = 10\n    sim.output.output_directory = \"output\"\n    \n    # Visualize using built-in viewer\n    sim.visualize = True\n    \n    return sim\n\n# Run simulation\nsim = setup()\nsim.run()\n```"
