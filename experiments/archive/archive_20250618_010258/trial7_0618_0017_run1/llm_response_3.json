    "response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file based on the provided ontology annotations. Let me break down the steps I took to create the code.\n\nFirst, I looked at the ontology annotations. They all point to a general \"cell\" term, so I decided to create a basic simulation with a single cell type. I named it 'DefaultCell' since it's the only type needed here.\n\nNext, I considered the necessary imports. The user mentioned including CompuCellSetup and steppables, so I imported CompuCellSetup and SteppableBasePy from steppables.\n\nI then created a simulation class, BasicSimulation, which inherits from SteppableBasePy. This class needs the required methods: __init__, start, and step. In the __init__ method, I set the simulation name and maximum steps. The start method initializes the simulation, and the step method handles the main loop, updating the simulation step.\n\nFor the cell parameters, I kept it simple with basic attributes like cellType, cellName, and a minimal volume to prevent cells from shrinking too much. I used the default cell type 'DefaultCell' and set a reasonable volume.\n\nI made sure the code is clean and only includes the necessary parts without any extra explanations or text, as per the user's request. I also ensured that the code is properly formatted and follows CompuCell3D conventions.\n\nFinally, I reviewed the code to make sure it meets all the specified requirements, including the correct imports, class structure, and methods. This should result in a functional simulation file that the user can run.\n</think>\n\n```python\nfrom CompuCell3D import CompuCellSetup\nfrom steppables import SteppableBasePy\n\nclass BasicSimulation(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, _simulator, _stock):\n        super().__init__(_simulator, _stock)\n        self.simulator = _simulator\n        self stock = _stock\n        self.simulation_name = \"Basic Cell Simulation\"\n        self.max_steps = 1000\n\n    def start(self):\n        self.simulator.print(\"Starting Basic Cell Simulation\")\n\n    def step(self, mcs):\n        self.simulator.print(f\"Step: {mcs}\")\n        if mcs == self.max_steps:\n            self.simulator.print(\"Simulation finished\")\n\ncell_type = \"DefaultCell\"\ncell_name = \"Basic Cell\"\ncell_parameters = {\n    \"cellType\": cell_type,\n    \"cellName\": cell_name,\n    \"volume\": 10,\n    \"minimalVolume\": 1\n}\n\nCompuCellSetup.setSimulationParameters(cell_parameters)\n```"
