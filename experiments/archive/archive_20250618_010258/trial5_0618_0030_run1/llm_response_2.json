    "response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to create a JSON object with ontology annotations for \"two brain cells.\" Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll consider the Cell Ontology. Brain cells can refer to neurons, which are a type of cell. So, I'll look up the Cell Ontology ID for neuron. I recall that neurons are often classified under \"CL:0000540\" with the term \"Neuron.\"\n\nNext, for the Gene Ontology, I need to think about processes related to brain cells. Neurogenesis is the process by which neurons are generated, so I'll find the GO ID for neurogenesis. It's \"GO:0022008\" with the term \"neurogenesis.\"\n\nThen, moving on to MeSH terms. Brain cells fall under the broader category of neuroglia or neurons. The MeSH term for neuroglia is \"D009464,\" but since the user mentioned \"brain cells\" generally, I think \"Neurons\" is more specific. However, checking MeSH, the term \"Neurons\" is under \"D009477.\" Wait, actually, \"Neurons\" is D009477, but I think \"Brain Cells\" might have a specific MeSH term. Alternatively, \"Neuroglia\" is D009464, but that refers more to glial cells. Since the user specified \"brain cells,\" which can include neurons, I'll go with \"D009477\" for Neurons.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with each ontology category, ensuring the IDs and terms are exact as per the format requirements.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000540\",\n            \"term\": \"Neuron\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0022008\",\n            \"term\": \"neurogenesis\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D009477\",\n            \"term\": \"Neurons\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```"
