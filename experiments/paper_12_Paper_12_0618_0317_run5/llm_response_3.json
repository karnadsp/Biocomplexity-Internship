    "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file based on the given ontology annotations. The user provided a Python code example, but I should think through how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the simulation should include the necessary imports. The example uses CompuCellSetup and steppables, so I'll include those. I'll also need to import numpy for any numerical operations, though in this case, it's not used, but it's good practice.\n\nNext, the simulation class must inherit from SteppableBasePy. The example uses MySimulation, which is a good name. I'll structure the class with __init__, start, and step methods.\n\nIn the __init__ method, I'll set the simulation name and number of steps. The example uses 1000 steps, which is reasonable. I'll also initialize a variable to track the current step.\n\nThe start method is called once at the beginning. Here, I'll print a message indicating the simulation has started. I might also set up initial conditions, but the example doesn't require it, so I'll keep it simple.\n\nThe step method runs every time step. I'll print the current step number and increment it. If the step reaches 1000, I'll print a completion message. This provides feedback on simulation progress.\n\nFor cell types and parameters, the ontology mentions Epithelial cells, Cell Division, and Cell Proliferation. I'll define a cell type 'Epithelial' with a proliferation parameter. The example sets cell_proliferation to 0.1, which seems appropriate.\n\nI'll structure the code with clear comments for each section, making it easy to understand. I'll ensure that the code is properly indented and follows Python syntax.\n\nFinally, I'll test the code in my mind to ensure it runs without errors. It should initialize, run for 1000 steps, and print messages at each step and upon completion.\n\nI think that covers all the requirements. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.\n</think>\n\n```python\nfrom CompuCell3D import CompuCellSetup\nfrom steppables import SteppableBasePy\nimport numpy\n\nclass MySimulation(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, _simulator, _num_steps):\n        SteppableBasePy.__init__(self, _simulator, _num_steps)\n        self.simulator = _simulator\n        self.num_steps = _num_steps\n        self.step_number = 0\n        \n    def start(self):\n        print(\"Simulation started.\")\n        \n    def step(self, mcs):\n        print(\"Step number: \", self.step_number)\n        self.step_number += 1\n        if self.step_number == self.num_steps:\n            print(\"Simulation completed.\")\n            \ndef main():\n    # Create simulation object\n    simulator = CompuCellSetup.Simulator()\n    \n    # Set simulation parameters\n    simulator.setSimulationDimensions(50, 50, 1)\n    simulator.setNumberOfSteps(1000)\n    simulator.setSaveOutputFrequency(100)\n    \n    # Register cell types\n    simulator.registerCellType(\"Epithelial\", \"Epithelial\")\n    \n    # Add steppable\n    simulator.addSteppable(MySimulation(simulator, 1000))\n    \n    # Run simulation\n    simulator.run()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```"
