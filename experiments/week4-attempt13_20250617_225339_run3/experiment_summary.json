The conditions of 2D migration on the surface, and 3D invasion into a collagen gel are represented as a cellular Potts model. The model demonstrates that a loss of endocardial adhesion is a sufficient condition for 2D migration behaviour, while a simultaneous loss of endocardial cohesion and gain in endocardial to collagen gel adhesion is a sufficient condition for 3D invasion. The 3D model captures the hierarchy effective surface tensions that correspond to the three experimental conditions of stable monolayer, 2D migration, and 3D invasion.

        "response": "<think> \n Alright ,  so  the  user  wants  me  to  create  a  JSON  object  with  ontology  annotations  based  on  their  provided  paper  description .  They  mentioned  including  Cell  Ont ology ,  GO ,  and  Me SH  terms .  First ,  I 'll  need  to  parse  the  original  description  carefully .\n\n The  paper  is  about  simulations  of  Ep ith elial  to  Mes ench ym al  Transition  ( EM T )  in  vitro .  So ,  I  should  look  for  terms  related  to  E MT  in  all  three  ont ologies .  Cell  Ont ology  probably  has  terms  for  epith elial  cells  and  mes ench ym al  cells .  GO  might  have  biological  processes  like  ' ep ith elial  to  mes ench ym al  transition '  and  ' cell  migration '.  Me SH  likely  has  terms  for  E MT  and  cell  migration  as  well .\n\n Next ,  the  paper  talks  about   2 D  migration  on  surfaces  and   3 D  invasion  into  collagen  gel .  I 'll  need  to  find  terms  related  to  cell  migration  in   2 D  and   3 D  environments .  Maybe  ' cell  migration '  is  a  general  term ,  but  I  should  check  if  there  are  more  specific  terms  for   2 D  and   3 D  in  GO  or  Me SH .\n\n The  model  used  is  a  cellular  P otts  model .  I  should  include  that  as  a  technique .  Looking  up ,  I  think  Me SH  has  ' Models ,  Biological '  which  could  cover  it .  GO  might  have  ' cell ular  model '  or  similar .\n\n Ad hesion  is  a  key  factor  here \u2014 end ocard ial  ad hesion  and  cohesion .  I 'll  need  terms  related  to  cell  ad hesion .  Cell  Ont ology  might  have  ' cell  ad hesion '  and  GO  could  have  ' cell  ad hesion '  as  a  biological  process .  Me SH  probably  has  terms  for  cell  ad hesion  too .\n\n The  paper  also  mentions  cell  shape  changes  and  mot ility .  So ,  I  should  include  terms  related  to  cell  shape  and  mot ility .  GO  likely  has  ' cell  shape '  and  ' mot ility '  as  biological  processes .  Me SH  might  have  similar  terms .\n\n I  should  structure  the  JSON  with  separate  categories  for  each  ontology .  Each  category  will  have  a  list  of  relevant  terms .  I 'll  make  sure  to  include  all  applicable  terms  from  each  ontology  without  overlapping  too  much .\n\n Wait ,  the  user  clarified  to  return  only  the  JSON ,  so  I  need  to  ensure  that  the  structure  is  correct  and  only  includes  the  necessary  terms .  I 'll  double -check  each  term  to  make  sure  they 're  accurate  and  relevant  to  the  context  provided .\n\n I  think  that 's  about  it .  Now ,  I 'll  compile  all  these  terms  into  the  JSON  structure  as  specified .\n </think> \n\n ``` json \n {\n    \" Cell  Ont ology \":  [\n      \" ep ith elial  cell \",\n      \" mes ench ym al  cell \",\n      \" end ocard ial  cell \"\n    ],\n    \" Gene  Ont ology \":  [\n      \" ep ith elial  to  mes ench ym al  transition \",\n      \" cell  migration \",\n      \" cell  ad hesion \",\n      \" cell  cohesion \",\n      \" coll agen  gel  ad hesion \",\n      \" cell  shape \",\n      \" cell  mot ility \"\n    ],\n    \" Me SH \":  [\n      \" Ep ith elial -M es ench ym al  Transition \",\n      \" Cell  Migration \",\n      \" Cell  Ad hesion \",\n      \" Coll agen \",\n      \" G els \",\n      \" Cell  Shape \",\n      \" Cell  Movement \",\n      \" Models ,  Biological \"\n    ]\n }\n ``` "

        "response": "<think> \n Okay ,  I  need  to  generate  a  valid  Com pu Cell 3 D  simulation  file  based  on  the  provided  ontology  annotations .  Let  me  break  down  the  problem  step  by  step .\n\n First ,  I 'll  look  at  the  ontology  terms  provided .  The  cell  types  include  epith elial ,  mes ench ym al ,  and  endoth elial  cells .  The  gene  ontology  terms  mention  processes  like  epith elial  to  mes ench ym al  transition ,  cell  migration ,  ad hesion ,  cohesion ,  collagen  gel  ad hesion ,  cell  shape ,  and  mot ility .  The  Me SH  terms  include  similar  concepts ,  focusing  on  transitions ,  migration ,  ad hesion ,  collagen ,  g els ,  cell  shape ,  movement ,  and  biological  models .\n\n So ,  the  simulation  should  model  epith elial  cells  undergoing  transition  to  mes ench ym al  cells ,  which  then  migrate .  End oth elial  cells  might  be  involved  in  ad hesion  and  cohesion ,  possibly  interacting  with  collagen  g els .  Cell  shape  and  mot ility  are  also  key  factors .\n\n I 'll  start  by  setting  up  the  simulation  class .  It  needs  to  inherit  from  Ste pp able Base Py .  The  required  methods  are  __ init __,  start ,  and  step .  In  the  __ init __,  I 'll  set  the  simulation  name  and  configuration  file .  The  start  method  will  initialize  the  simulation ,  reading  cell  types  and  setting  up  the  field  for  the  collagen  gel .\n\n Next ,  in  the  step  method ,  I 'll  handle  the  main  simulation  loop .  I 'll  process  each  cell ,  checking  if  it 's  epith elial  and  triggering  E MT  if  conditions  are  met .  For  mes ench ym al  cells ,  I 'll  manage  migration  and  ad hesion .  End oth elial  cells  will  have  their  own  ad hesion  and  cohesion  logic .  I 'll  also  update  the  collagen  field  based  on  cell  presence .\n\n I  need  to  include  the  necessary  imports ,  like  Com pu Cell Setup  and  the  relevant  ste pp ables .  The  simulation  should  use  a  G CM esh  for  the  lattice  and  configure  the  simulation  duration ,  output ,  and  solver .\n\n I 'll  structure  the  code  with  the  simulation  class ,  initializing  cell  types ,  and  setting  up  the  ste pp able .  The  step  method  will  handle  the  core  logic  based  on  cell  types  and  their  behaviors  as  per  the  ontology  terms .\n\n I 'll  make  sure  the  code  is  clean ,  with  proper  indentation  and  comments  for  clarity .
