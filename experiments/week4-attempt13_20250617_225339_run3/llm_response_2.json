    "prompt": "Original description: This paper presents simulations of in vitro Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). The conditions of 2D migration on the surface, and 3D invasion into a collagen gel are represented as a cellular Potts model. The model demonstrates that a loss of endocardial adhesion is a sufficient condition for 2D migration behaviour, while a simultaneous loss of endocardial cohesion and gain in endocardial to collagen gel adhesion is a sufficient condition for 3D invasion. The 3D model captures the hierarchy effective surface tensions that correspond to the three experimental conditions of stable monolayer, 2D migration, and 3D invasion. A 2D cellular Potts model is used to investigate the relationship between cell shape changes, motility and adhesion during the condition of 2D migration.\n\nClarifications provided: \n\n\n    Return ONLY a JSON object with ontology annotations.",

    "response": "<think> \n Alright ,  so  the  user  wants  me  to  create  a  JSON  object  with  ontology  annotations  based  on  their  provided  paper  description .  They  mentioned  including  Cell  Ont ology ,  GO ,  and  Me SH  terms .  First ,  I 'll  need  to  parse  the  original  description  carefully .\n\n The  paper  is  about  simulations  of  Ep ith elial  to  Mes ench ym al  Transition  ( EM T )  in  vitro .  So ,  I  should  look  for  terms  related  to  E MT  in  all  three  ont ologies .  Cell  Ont ology  probably  has  terms  for  epith elial  cells  and  mes ench ym al  cells .  GO  might  have  biological  processes  like  ' ep ith elial  to  mes ench ym al  transition '  and  ' cell  migration '.  Me SH  likely  has  terms  for  E MT  and  cell  migration  as  well .\n\n Next ,  the  paper  talks  about   2 D  migration  on  surfaces  and   3 D  invasion  into  collagen  gel .  I 'll  need  to  find  terms  related  to  cell  migration  in   2 D  and   3 D  environments .  Maybe  ' cell  migration '  is  a  general  term ,  but  I  should  check  if  there  are  more  specific  terms  for   2 D  and   3 D  in  GO  or  Me SH .\n\n The  model  used  is  a  cellular  P otts  model .  I  should  include  that  as  a  technique .  Looking  up ,  I  think  Me SH  has  ' Models ,  Biological '  which  could  cover  it .  GO  might  have  ' cell ular  model '  or  similar .\n\n Ad hesion  is  a  key  factor  here \u2014 end ocard ial  ad hesion  and  cohesion .  I 'll  need  terms  related  to  cell  ad hesion .  Cell  Ont ology  might  have  ' cell  ad hesion '  and  GO  could  have  ' cell  ad hesion '  as  a  biological  process .  Me SH  probably  has  terms  for  cell  ad hesion  too .\n\n The  paper  also  mentions  cell  shape  changes  and  mot ility .  So ,  I  should  include  terms  related  to  cell  shape  and  mot ility .  GO  likely  has  ' cell  shape '  and  ' mot ility '  as  biological  processes .  Me SH  might  have  similar  terms .\n\n I  should  structure  the  JSON  with  separate  categories  for  each  ontology .  Each  category  will  have  a  list  of  relevant  terms .  I 'll  make  sure  to  include  all  applicable  terms  from  each  ontology  without  overlapping  too  much .\n\n Wait ,  the  user  clarified  to  return  only  the  JSON ,  so  I  need  to  ensure  that  the  structure  is  correct  and  only  includes  the  necessary  terms .  I 'll  double -check  each  term  to  make  sure  they 're  accurate  and  relevant  to  the  context  provided .\n\n I  think  that 's  about  it .  Now ,  I 'll  compile  all  these  terms  into  the  JSON  structure  as  specified .\n </think> \n\n ``` json \n {\n    \" Cell  Ont ology \":  [\n      \" ep ith elial  cell \",\n      \" mes ench ym al  cell \",\n      \" end ocard ial  cell \"\n    ],\n    \" Gene  Ont ology \":  [\n      \" ep ith elial  to  mes ench ym al  transition \",\n      \" cell  migration \",\n      \" cell  ad hesion \",\n      \" cell  cohesion \",\n      \" coll agen  gel  ad hesion \",\n      \" cell  shape \",\n      \" cell  mot ility \"\n    ],\n    \" Me SH \":  [\n      \" Ep ith elial -M es ench ym al  Transition \",\n      \" Cell  Migration \",\n      \" Cell  Ad hesion \",\n      \" Coll agen \",\n      \" G els \",\n      \" Cell  Shape \",\n      \" Cell  Movement \",\n      \" Models ,  Biological \"\n    ]\n }\n ``` "
