    "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file based on the given ontology annotations. Let me break down the requirements.\n\nFirst, the user provided an example response, so I should follow that structure. The code needs to include specific imports, a simulation class with certain methods, and use the given ontologies to define cell types and parameters.\n\nThe ontologies given are:\n- CellOntology: Epithelial (CL:0000000)\n- GeneOntology: Cell Division (GO:0000000)\n- MeSH: Cell Proliferation (D000000)\n\nI'll start by importing the necessary modules. The example used CompuCellSetup, which is essential, and steppables for the simulation steps. So I'll include those.\n\nNext, I'll create a simulation class that inherits from SteppableBasePy. The example named it EpithelialProliferationSimulation, which makes sense given the ontologies. I'll follow that naming convention.\n\nIn the __init__ method, I'll call the superclass's __init__ and set the simulation name. Then, in the start method, I'll define the simulation parameters. The example used a 2D simulation with a 100x100 lattice, which I'll replicate. I'll set the time and output parameters as well.\n\nFor cell types, the example used Epithelial cells with a proliferation parameter. I'll create a cell type called Epithelial with the same parameters, referencing the ontology IDs provided. I'll also set the default cell type to ensure the simulation starts correctly.\n\nIn the step method, I'll add logic related to cell division. The example added a mitosis steppable, so I'll include that. I'll reference the GeneOntology for cell division and set the mitosis parameters, such as the number of steps and the schedule.\n\nI need to make sure all the ontology references are correctly included in the comments and parameter descriptions. This helps in linking the simulation components back to the original ontologies.\n\nI'll also include the required parameters like volume and surface area constraints, as these are standard in CompuCell3D simulations. The example used specific values, so I'll match those to ensure consistency.\n\nFinally, I'll structure the code without any additional text or explanations, as per the user's instructions. I'll ensure that the code is clean and only includes the necessary parts.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll write the Python code with the imports, simulation class, and all the required methods and parameters, making sure it aligns with the provided example and the given ontologies.\n</think>\n\n```python\nfrom CompuCell3D import CompuCellSetup\nfrom steppables import SteppableBasePy\n\nclass EpithelialProliferationSimulation(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, _simulator, _model):\n        SteppableBasePy.__init__(self, _simulator, _model)\n        self.simulator = _simulator\n        self.model = _model\n        \n    def start(self):\n        self.simulator.setSimulationName(\"EpithelialProliferation\")\n        self.simulator.setSimulationTime(1000)\n        self.simulator.setOutputDirectory(\"EpithelialProliferationOutput\")\n        \n        # Create a 2D lattice\n        self.simulator.createLattice(100, 100, 1)\n        \n        # Register cell types\n        self.cellTypeManager.registerCellType(\"Epithelial\", \"CL:0000000\")\n        \n        # Set default cell type\n        self.cellTypeManager.setDefaultCellType(\"Epithelial\")\n        \n        # Add cell proliferation parameters\n        self.model.addSteppable(_steppable=self)\n        \n    def step(self):\n        # Add cell division logic\n        self.model.addSteppable(Mitosis(\"GO:0000000\"))\n        \n        # Add cell proliferation logic\n        self.model.addSteppable(Proliferation(\"D000000\"))\n        \n    def finish(self):\n        pass\n\n# Define cell proliferation parameters\nclass Epithelial(CompuCellSetup.CellG):\n    def __init__(self):\n        CompuCellSetup.CellG.__init__(self)\n        self.volume = 1\n        self.surfaceArea = 1\n        self.protrusionDepth = 0\n        self.protrusionVolume = 0\n        self.cellType = \"Epithelial\"\n        self.cellTypeId = 0\n        self.cellAdhesion = 0\n        self.cellProliferation = 1\n\n# Define mitosis parameters\nclass Mitosis(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, _ontology):\n        SteppableBasePy.__init__(self, None, None)\n        self.ontology = _ontology\n        self.mitosisSteps = 10\n        self.mitosisSchedule = 100\n\n# Define proliferation parameters\nclass Proliferation(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, _mesh):\n        SteppableBasePy.__init__(self, None, None)\n        self.mesh = _mesh\n        self.proliferationRate = 0.1\n        self.proliferationSteps = 50\n```"
