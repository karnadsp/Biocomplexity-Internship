In this work we present experimental results of aggregates fusion using adipose derived stem cells (ADSC) and a three dimensional computer simulation of the process using the cellular Potts model with aggregates reaching 10,000 cells. We consider fusion of round aggregates and monitor the dimensionless neck area of contact between the two aggregates to characterize the process, as done for the coalescence of liquid droplets and polymers. Both experiments and simulations show that the evolution of this quantity obeys a power law in time. We also study quantitatively individual cell motion with the simulation and it corresponds to an anomalous diffusion."

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a JSON object with ontology annotations based on the provided information. Let's start by parsing the original description and identifying relevant terms for each ontology category: CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH.\n\nFirst, the text mentions \"adipose derived stem cells (ADSC)\". Adipose-derived stem cells are a type of cell, so I should look up their Cell Ontology ID. The correct CL term for adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells is CL:0001052. So that's one entry for CellOntology.\n\nNext, for GeneOntology, the main processes mentioned are cell aggregation and cell migration. The text talks about \"aggregates fusion\" and \"individual cell motion\". Cell aggregation in GO is GO:0098743. Cell migration is GO:0016477. I need to check if those IDs are correct. Yes, GO:0098743 is indeed \"cell aggregation\" and GO:0016477 is \"cell migration\".\n\nNow, MeSH terms. The study involves tissue engineering and biological models. Tissue engineering is MeSH D054511. The cellular Potts model is a computational model used here, but MeSH might not have a specific term for that. However, \"Models, Biological\" is a MeSH term, D008957. Also, \"Cell Movement\" is D002465, which aligns with the cell motion studied. So those three MeSH terms seem appropriate.\n\nI need to ensure that the IDs are formatted without spaces and terms are correctly capitalized. For example, \"Adipose-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells\" should be the exact term from Cell Ontology. Similarly, \"Cell Aggregation\" and \"Cell Migration\" for GO terms. For MeSH, \"Tissue Engineering\", \"Models, Biological\", and \"Cell Movement\".\n\nDouble-checking the IDs:\n- CL:0001052 is correct for adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells.\n- GO:0098743 (cell aggregation) and GO:0016477 (cell migration) are valid.\n- MeSH D054511 (Tissue Engineering), D008957 (Models, Biological), D002465 (Cell Movement).\n\nNo extra spaces in IDs or terms. The JSON structure should have arrays under each category with id and term pairs. Make sure the category names are exact as specified. That should cover all required ontologies based on the provided information.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0001052\",\n            \"term\": \"Adipose-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0098743\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Aggregation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0016477\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Migration\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D054511\",\n            \"term\": \"Tissue Engineering\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D008957\",\n            \"term\": \"Models, Biological\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002465\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Movement\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"
