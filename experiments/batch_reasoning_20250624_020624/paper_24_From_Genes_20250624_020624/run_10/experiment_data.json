      "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a JSON object with ontology annotations based on the provided information. Let's start by understanding the user's query. They want annotations for Cell Ontology, Gene Ontology, and MeSH terms related to CompuCell3D, which is a simulation environment for morphogenesis.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the original description. CompuCell3D is used for morphogenesis simulations. Morphogenesis involves processes like cell differentiation, tissue organization, and pattern formation. So, for Gene Ontology (GO), terms related to these biological processes would be relevant. Possible GO terms could be \"Pattern specification process\" (GO:0007389), \"Cell morphogenesis\" (GO:0000902), and \"Developmental process\" (GO:0032502). I'll need to verify these IDs and terms to ensure they're exact.\n\nNext, Cell Ontology. The application simulates cell behaviors, so terms like \"Somatic cell\" (CL:0002371) might be appropriate since it's a general term for body cells involved in morphogenesis. Also, maybe \"Stromal cell\" (CL:0000499) if the simulations include tissue stroma. I should check the Cell Ontology for exact terms and IDs.\n\nFor MeSH terms, morphogenesis is a key term here. MeSH has \"Morphogenesis\" (D009024) and \"Cell Differentiation\" (D002454). \"Computer Simulation\" (D003199) is also relevant since CompuCell3D is a simulation tool. I need to confirm the MeSH IDs and ensure the terms are correctly formatted without extra spaces.\n\nI must adhere strictly to the format: exact category names, IDs without spaces, and term names correctly capitalized and spaced. No extra explanations, just the JSON. Let me cross-check each term and ID to make sure they're accurate. Once verified, structure the JSON accordingly under the specified categories.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0002371\",\n            \"term\": \"Somatic cell\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000499\",\n            \"term\": \"Stromal cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007389\",\n            \"term\": \"Pattern specification process\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0000902\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell morphogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0032502\",\n            \"term\": \"Developmental process\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D009024\",\n            \"term\": \"Morphogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002454\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Differentiation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D003199\",\n            \"term\": \"Computer Simulation\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"
