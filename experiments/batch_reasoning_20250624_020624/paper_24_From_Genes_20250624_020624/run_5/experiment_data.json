      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user wants me to create a JSON object with ontology annotations based on the given information about CompuCell3D. The ontologies needed are CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH. But wait, the original description is about software development for morphogenesis simulations. So I need to map terms related to that.\n\nFirst, I should look for relevant terms in each ontology. For CellOntology, morphogenesis involves cells like epithelial or mesenchymal. Let me check Cell Ontology IDs. Epithelial cells are CL:0000066, and mesenchymal stem cells are CL:0000134. But the term \"Mesenchymal\" might be a broader category. I need to confirm the exact term and ID.\n\nGeneOntology terms related to morphogenesis. Processes like \"Morphogenesis\" (GO:0009653) and \"Pattern Specification\" (GO:0007389) are relevant. Also, \"Cell-Cell Adhesion\" (GO:0098609) might be involved in cell interactions during morphogenesis.\n\nFor MeSH, terms like \"Morphogenesis\" (D009024) and \"Software\" (D012984) since it's a software tool. Maybe \"Computer Simulation\" (D003196) as well. Let me verify the exact MeSH terms and IDs.\n\nWait, the example uses \"Cell Division\" and \"Cell Proliferation\", but here the context is simulation software. So the terms should relate to the biological processes being simulated, not the software itself. However, MeSH might include terms about software. So \"Software\" (D012984) and \"Computer Simulation\" (D003196) are appropriate here. But the original description mentions morphogenesis simulations, so \"Morphogenesis\" (D009024) should be in MeSH.\n\nNow, assembling everything. CellOntology would have Epithelial and Mesenchymal cells. GeneOntology includes morphogenesis, pattern specification, and cell-cell adhesion. MeSH includes Morphogenesis, Computer Simulation, and Software.\n\nNeed to ensure all IDs are correctly formatted without spaces. Also, check term names for exactness. Epithelial (CL:0000066), Mesenchymal (CL:0000134). GO terms: GO:0009653 (Morphogenesis), GO:0007389 (Pattern Specification), GO:0098609 (Cell-Cell Adhesion). MeSH: D009024 (Morphogenesis), D003196 (Computer Simulation), D012984 (Software).\n\nPutting it all into the JSON structure as specified, with exact category names and correct IDs/terms. Make sure there's no extra spacing or formatting issues. Double-check everything matches the requirements.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000066\",\n            \"term\": \"Epithelial\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000134\",\n            \"term\": \"Mesenchymal\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0009653\",\n            \"term\": \"Morphogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007389\",\n            \"term\": \"Pattern Specification\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0098609\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell-Cell Adhesion\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D009024\",\n            \"term\": \"Morphogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D003196\",\n            \"term\": \"Computer Simulation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D012984\",\n            \"term\": \"Software\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"

The imports usually include CompuCellSetup and various modules like steppables. Then, the simulation class should inherit from SteppableBasePy.

The step method defines actions taken each simulation step.\n\nThe ontology mentions two cell types: Epithelial and Mesenchymal. So I need to define these in the start method using self.cellType. Also, GeneOntology terms like cell adhesion suggest including adhesion parameters, maybe in the contact energy between cells. Morphogenesis and pattern specification might involve setting up a gradient or chemotaxis, but since the user didn't specify details, I'll include a basic chemotaxis setup for epithelial cells towards a field.\n\nI should set up the simulation dimensions with CompuCellSetup.
