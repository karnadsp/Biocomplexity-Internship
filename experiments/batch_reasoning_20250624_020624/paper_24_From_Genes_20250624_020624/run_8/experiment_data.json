      "response": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to create structured ontology annotations for the provided information about CompuCell3D. They specified CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH terms.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original description. It mentions morphogenesis simulations, procedural languages like C or Fortran, and CompuCell3D being a C++ environment using object-oriented design. The key focus here is on morphogenesis, simulations, programming languages, and software design.\n\nFor CellOntology, morphogenesis is related to cell development. The term \"Morphogenesis\" in Cell Ontology has the ID CL:0000003. Wait, no, actually, I should check. Morphogenesis is a process, so maybe it's under Gene Ontology instead. Cell Ontology terms are specific cell types. Hmm, maybe \"Stem Cell\" or \"Epithelial Cell\"? But the original text doesn't specify cell types. Maybe the user expects CellOntology terms related to morphogenesis, but I might need to confirm. Wait, the example given in the problem uses \"Epithelial\" under CellOntology. But the original text here doesn't mention epithelial cells. Perhaps the correct approach is to leave CellOntology empty if there's no explicit cell type mentioned. But the example included it, so maybe the user expects something here. Alternatively, maybe \"Simulated Cell\" or something, but that's not a standard term. Maybe there's no applicable CellOntology term here, so the CellOntology array would be empty.\n\nNext, GeneOntology. The process of morphogenesis is a biological process. The GO term for morphogenesis is GO:0009653. Also, the software is for simulation, which might relate to computational modeling. The GO term for computational modeling is GO:0035914. Additionally, object-oriented design in software development could relate to \"software framework\" but I need to check GO terms. Alternatively, \"computer simulation\" might be a MeSH term. Wait, Gene Ontology includes biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components. So computational modeling here is a biological process term in GO. Let me verify: GO:0035914 is \"cellular component morphogenesis\", but maybe the broader term for morphogenesis is GO:0009653. Also, the software's purpose is simulation of biological processes, so maybe \"simulation of biological process\" but that might not exist. Alternatively, \"developmental process\" (GO:0032502). Hmm, perhaps \"morphogenesis\" (GO:0009653) and \"computational modeling\" (GO:0035914) are appropriate here.\n\nFor MeSH terms, the software is a problem-solving environment, which might be under \"Software\" (D012984). Also, \"Computer Simulation\" is a MeSH term (D003196). Additionally, \"Morphogenesis\" as a MeSH term is D009048. So MeSH entries would include \"Computer Simulation\", \"Software\", and \"Morphogenesis\".\n\nWait, the original description mentions \"morphogenesis simulations\", so the MeSH terms should include D003196 (Computer Simulation), D009048 (Morphogenesis), and D012984 (Software). \n\nPutting it all together:\n\nCellOntology: The original text doesn't mention specific cell types, so maybe empty. But the example included Epithelial, but that was an example. If there's no explicit cell type, it should be empty. Let me confirm. The user's example included \"Epithelial\" under CellOntology, but in this case, the text doesn't specify any cell type. So CellOntology array is empty.\n\nGeneOntology: GO:0009653 (morphogenesis), GO:0035914 (cellular component morphogenesis), and perhaps GO:0016042 (cellular process), but the first two are more relevant. Alternatively, computational modeling as GO:0035914. So morphogenesis and computational modeling.\n\nMeSH: D003196 (Computer Simulation), D009048 (Morphogenesis), D012984 (Software).\n\nI need to check the exact IDs and terms. Let me verify each:\n\n- Gene Ontology:\n  - Morphogenesis: GO:0009653, term \"anatomical structure morphogenesis\"\n  Wait, GO:0009653 is \"anatomical structure morphogenesis\", which is a child of \"morphogenesis of a structure\" (GO:0009652). Maybe \"morphogenesis\" is a broader term. Alternatively, \"biological process\" is too general. But the correct term for morphogenesis as a biological process is GO:0009653. Alternatively, if the software is simulating cell morphogenesis, maybe \"cell morphogenesis\" (GO:0000902). But the text just says \"morphogenesis simulations\". So perhaps GO:0009653 is appropriate.\n\n  - Computational modeling: GO:0035914 is \"cellular component morphogenesis\", which might not be right. Wait, looking up GO terms, \"computational modeling\" isn't exactly a GO term. Maybe \"simulation of biological process\" is not a standard term. Alternatively, \"model organism\" terms aren't here. Perhaps the relevant GO terms are \"developmental process\" (GO:0032502) and \"anatomical structure morphogenesis\" (GO:0009653). Alternatively, maybe there's a term for \"simulation\" in GO, but I don't think so. So maybe just morphogenesis here.\n\nWait, perhaps the GeneOntology entries are only morphogenesis (GO:0009653) and maybe \"cell differentiation\" (GO:0030154) if applicable. But the text doesn't mention differentiation. So maybe just GO:0009653.\n\nMeSH terms are Computer Simulation (D003196), Morphogenesis (D009048), and Software (D012984).\n\nTherefore, the JSON should have:\n\n- CellOntology: empty array (no specific cell type mentioned)\n- GeneOntology: GO:0009653 (anatomical structure morphogenesis)\n- MeSH: D003196, D009048, D012984\n\nBut wait, the original example includes entries even if they are empty? The example has all three categories. So even if CellOntology is empty, it should be present as an empty array.\n\nWait, the user's example includes all three categories, each as an array. So even if there are no terms, the category should be present with an empty array. Let me check the example:\n\nIn the example, all three categories are present. So even if no terms, include the category with empty array.\n\nSo, in this case, since there's no mention of specific cell types, CellOntology should be an empty array. GeneOntology and MeSH would have their respective terms.\n\nTherefore, the final JSON should be:\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0009653\",\n            \"term\": \"anatomical structure morphogenesis\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D003196\",\n            \"term\": \"Computer Simulation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D009048\",\n            \"term\": \"Morphogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D012984\",\n            \"term\": \"Software\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWait, but the term for GO:0009653 is \"anatomical structure morphogenesis\", but the user example uses terms like \"Cell Division\" which is more concise. However, the exact term must be used. So if the official term is \"anatomical structure morphogenesis\", that's what must be used.\n\nSimilarly, for MeSH, \"Computer Simulation\" is the exact term, \"Morphogenesis\" is correct, and \"Software\".\n\nYes, that seems accurate.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0009653\",\n            \"term\": \"anatomical structure morphogenesis\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D003196\",\n            \"term\": \"Computer Simulation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D009048\",\n            \"term\": \"Morphogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D012984\",\n            \"term\": \"Software\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"
