This process of cell movements organizes the ommatidial array into a functional pattern. Unlike earlier simulations that focused on the arrangements of cells within individual ommatidia, here we examine the local movements that lead to large-scale organization of the emerging eye field. Simulations based on our experimental observations of cell adhesion, cell death, and cell movement successfully patterned a tracing of an emerging wild-type pupal eye. Surprisingly, altering cell adhesion had only a mild effect on patterning, contradicting our previous hypothesis that the patterning was primarily the result of referential adhesion between IRMclass surface proteins. Instead, our simulations highlighted the importance of programmed cell death (PCD) as well as a previously unappreciated variable: the expansion of cells\u2019 apical surface areas, which promoted rearrangement of neighboring cells. We tested this prediction experimentally by preventing expansion in the apical area of individual cells: patterning was disrupted in a manner predicted by our simulations. Our work demonstrates the value of combining computer simulation with in vivo experiments to uncover novel mechanisms that are perpetuated throughout the eye field. It also demonstrates the utility of the Glazier\u2013Graner\u2013Hogeweg model (GGH) for modeling the links between local cellular interactions and emergent properties of developing epithelia as well as predicting unanticipated results in vivo."

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants a JSON object with ontology annotations based on the provided biological description. The categories must be CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH, each with their respective IDs and terms.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original description to identify relevant terms. The study is about glial-like support cells in the Drosophila pupal eye, focusing on cell adhesion, programmed cell death (PCD), cell movement, and apical surface area expansion. The simulation used the GGH model.\n\nFor CellOntology: The main cell type mentioned is glial-like support cells. Looking up Cell Ontology, \"glial cell\" would be CL:0000122. Also, since the study involves epithelial cells (as they mention developing epithelia), maybe \"epithelial cell\" CL:0000066.\n\nGeneOntology: Processes involved include cell adhesion (GO:0007155), programmed cell death (GO:0012501), cell motility (GO:0016477), and cell surface area changes. The apical surface area expansion might relate to \"cell morphogenesis\" (GO:0000902). The GGH model is for morphogenesis, so maybe that's relevant. Also, \"biological adhesion\" (GO:0022610) as a parent term.\n\nMeSH terms: Programmed cell death is MeSH D017209. Cell movement is MeSH D002465. Cell adhesion is MeSH D002448. Morphogenesis is D009028. Maybe also \"Epithelium\" as a MeSH term D004848.\n\nWait, need to check exact MeSH terms. For example, \"Morphogenesis\" is D009028. \"Cell Adhesion\" is D002448. \"Cell Movement\" D002465. \"Apoptosis\" (a type of PCD) is D017209. Also, \"Epithelial Cells\" in MeSH is D004848. The study mentions epithelia, so that's relevant.\n\nCheck exact term names. For CellOntology, \"glial cell\" vs \"glial-like support cells\". The exact term is \"glial cell\" (CL:0000122). Epithelial cell is CL:0000066. \n\nGeneOntology: Cell adhesion (GO:0007155), programmed cell death (GO:0012501), cell motility (GO:0016477), cell morphogenesis (GO:0000902). Also, maybe \"cell surface\" (GO:0009986) but not sure if that's directly mentioned. The expansion of apical surface areas might relate to \"cell morphogenesis\" or \"cell size control\" (GO:0008361), but the text specifically mentions \"expansion of cells\u2019 apical surface areas\" which might not have a direct GO term. Maybe \"cell morphogenesis\" is the closest.\n\nMeSH terms: Programmed Cell Death (D017209), Cell Movement (D002465), Cell Adhesion (D002448), Epithelium (D004848), and Morphogenesis (D009028).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nCellOntology:\n- CL:0000122 glial cell\n- CL:0000066 epithelial cell\n\nGeneOntology:\n- GO:0007155 cell adhesion\n- GO:0012501 programmed cell death\n- GO:0016477 cell motility\n- GO:0000902 cell morphogenesis\n\nMeSH:\n- D017209 Programmed Cell Death\n- D002465 Cell Movement\n- D002448 Cell Adhesion\n- D004848 Epithelium\n- D009028 Morphogenesis\n\nNeed to ensure the terms are exact. Check MeSH for \"Epithelium\" (D004848) and \"Morphogenesis\" (D009028). Also, Gene Ontology terms should match exactly. Programmed cell death is GO:0012501, cell motility is GO:0016477. Cell adhesion is GO:0007155. Cell morphogenesis is GO:0000902.\n\nYes, that looks correct. Now structure the JSON as per the example, making sure the categories are exact, IDs have no spaces, and term names are correct.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000122\",\n            \"term\": \"glial cell\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000066\",\n            \"term\": \"epithelial cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007155\",\n            \"term\": \"cell adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0012501\",\n            \"term\": \"programmed cell death\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0016477\",\n            \"term\": \"cell motility\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0000902\",\n            \"term\": \"cell morphogenesis\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D017209\",\n            \"term\": \"Programmed Cell Death\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002465\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Movement\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002448\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D004848\",\n            \"term\": \"Epithelium\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D009028\",\n            \"term\": \"Morphogenesis\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"

Then, a simulation class that inherits from SteppableBasePy. The class must have __init__, start, and step methods.\n\nThe ontology annotations include two cell types: epithelial and glial cells. So I'll define those in the start method using self.cellType. For parameters, the GeneOntology terms mention morphogenesis, adhesion, death, and motility. MeSH terms add cell movement, adhesion, epithelium, etc. So I'll set appropriate parameters in the start method, like adhesion energies, motility parameters, and death rate.\n\nIn the __init__ method, I need to call the parent's __init__ with frequency. The start method initializes cell types and parameters. The step method can check for cell death by random chance each step. Also, maybe apply a motility constraint or something related to cell movement.\n\nWait, for cell motility, in CompuCell3D, the lambda vec parameter in the volume plugin affects cell movement. But the user might expect setting a parameter related to motility. Also, programmed cell death can be implemented by killing cells based on a probability in the step method.\n\nSo, in the step method, loop through each cell and check if a random number is below the death probability. If so, kill the cell. For morphogenesis, maybe adjust adhesion energies or other parameters.
