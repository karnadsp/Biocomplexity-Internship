      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by breaking down the original description to identify key terms that belong to the specified ontologies. \n\nFirst, the main focus is on glial-like support cells in the Drosophila pupal eye. For Cell Ontology (CellOntology), terms related to specific cell types are needed. The text mentions \"glial-like support cells,\" but I need to check if there's a precise Cell Ontology term for that. Maybe \"Glial cell\" exists. The CL ID for glial cells in Drosophila might not be straightforward. Alternatively, considering the context is epithelial tissue, \"Epithelial cells\" might be relevant. Wait, the example uses \"Epithelial\" as a term. Let me confirm the correct CL ID for epithelial cells. CL:0000066 is for epithelial cell. Also, the process involves the eye, so perhaps \"Ommatidial cell\" is another term, but I need to check if that's in Cell Ontology. Alternatively, maybe \"Retinal cell\" or \"Photoreceptor cell\" but the text is about support cells forming a lattice. Hmm.\n\nNext, Gene Ontology (GeneOntology) terms. The processes mentioned include cell adhesion (GO:0007155), programmed cell death (GO:0012501), cell movement (GO:0016477), and cell surface area expansion, which might relate to cell morphogenesis (GO:0000902). Also, the simulation model used is Glazier\u2013Graner\u2013Hogeweg (GGH), which is a cellular Potts model. Not sure if that has a GO term, but maybe not. Focus on the biological processes described.\n\nFor MeSH terms, the study involves cell adhesion (MeSH D002448), cell death (MeSH D016923), cell movement (D002465), and possibly epithelial cells (D004848). Also, developmental biology (D002869) or computer simulation (D003196) might be relevant. The mention of Drosophila as the organism could be MeSH D004325, but the instructions don't specify including species unless it's a term related to the process. Wait, the example included \"Cell Proliferation\" as a MeSH term. So processes like cell adhesion, cell death, cell movement, and epithelial cells would be appropriate here.\n\nWait, need to ensure exact term names. For example, \"Programmed Cell Death\" is a term, but MeSH uses \"Apoptosis\" (D017209) as well. However, the original text says \"programmed cell death (PCD)\", so maybe the exact MeSH term is \"Cell Death\" (D016923), since PCD is a type of cell death. Alternatively, \"Apoptosis\" might be more specific. But the text refers to PCD generally. Let me check MeSH for \"Programmed Cell Death\". MeSH does have D017209 for Apoptosis, but also D017126 for \"Cell Death\", which includes programmed cell death. So maybe \"Cell Death\" is the broader term. The text mentions \"programmed cell death (PCD) as well as...\", so \"Cell Death\" would cover PCD.\n\nCell adhesion in MeSH is D002448 (Cell Adhesion), cell movement is D002465 (Cell Movement), and epithelial cells are D004848 (Epithelial Cells). The simulation model, GGH, might not have a MeSH term, but the application is in developmental biology (D002869) and computer simulation (D003196).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nCellOntology: \n- Glial cells? Check CL. Maybe CL:0000125 (microglial cell) but that's for mammals. Alternatively, CL:0002600 (glial cell) from Drosophila? Wait, the CL term for glial cell in fruit fly might be CL:0000213 (adult glial cell). But not sure. Alternatively, maybe the study refers to epithelial cells forming the lattice, so \"Epithelial Cell\" CL:0000066. Also, the hexagonal lattice is part of epithelial structure.\n\nGeneOntology:\n- Cell adhesion (GO:0007155)\n- Programmed cell death (GO:0012501)\n- Cell motility (GO:0016477)\n- Cell morphogenesis involved in differentiation (GO:0000904) for surface area expansion.\n\nMeSH:\n- Cell Adhesion (D002448)\n- Cell Death (D016923)\n- Cell Movement (D002465)\n- Epithelial Cells (D004848)\n- Computer Simulation (D003196)\n- Developmental Biology (D002869)\n\nCheck if all terms are exact. For example, \"Cell Adhesion\" in MeSH is correct. \"Epithelial Cells\" is the term. \"Programmed Cell Death\" is part of GO as \"programmed cell death\" (GO:0012501), but the term name in GO is \"programmed cell death\". Wait, the exact term in GO is \"programmed cell death\" (GO:0012501). So in the GeneOntology section, it should be \"programmed cell death\".\n\nSo the JSON would be structured with these terms, ensuring IDs are correct and no extra spaces. Also, check that all category names are exact: CellOntology, GeneOntology, MeSH.\n\nWait, the original text mentions \"expansion of cells\u2019 apical surface areas\". For GO, maybe \"cell morphogenesis\" (GO:0000902) or \"cell morphogenesis involved in differentiation\" (GO:0000904). Let me check. GO:0000902 is \"cell morphogenesis\", which is the process. The expansion of apical surface area is part of morphogenesis, so maybe GO:0000902. Alternatively, \"cell morphogenesis involved in differentiation\" (GO:0000904) if it's part of differentiation. The text says \"expansion of cells\u2019 apical surface areas, which promoted rearrangement of neighboring cells.\" So maybe \"cell morphogenesis\" (GO:0000902).\n\nSo GeneOntology entries would be:\n- cell adhesion (GO:0007155)\n- programmed cell death (GO:0012501)\n- cell motility (GO:0016477)\n- cell morphogenesis (GO:0000902)\n\nFor MeSH, maybe also include \"Epithelium\" (D004848) as \"Epithelial Cells\" is D004848. \"Developmental Biology\" (D002869) and \"Computer Simulation\" (D003196) are relevant as the study combines simulation with experiments.\n\nPutting it all into the JSON structure, ensuring correct formatting. Now check each term and ID for accuracy.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000066\",\n            \"term\": \"Epithelial Cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007155\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0012501\",\n            \"term\": \"Programmed Cell Death\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0016477\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Motility\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0000902\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Morphogenesis\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002448\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D016923\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Death\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002465\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Movement\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D004848\",\n            \"term\": \"Epithelial Cells\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D003196\",\n            \"term\": \"Computer Simulation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002869\",\n            \"term\": \"Developmental Biology\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"

Basic cell types and parameters based on the ontology annotations",
      "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file based on the provided ontology annotations. Let's start by understanding the requirements. The user wants a Python script that includes specific components: necessary imports, a simulation class inheriting from SteppableBasePy, and the __init__, start, and step methods. Also, the code should incorporate basic cell types and parameters related to the given ontologies.\n\nFirst, the imports. CompuCellSetup is essential for setting up the simulation. From the steppables module, I'll need SteppableBasePy. Also, since there's cell motility and adhesion mentioned, I should include the VolumeLocalFlex and ContactLocalProductFlex plugins. Oh, right, those are part of CompuCell's core modules, so I'll import them.\n\nNext, the simulation class. It should inherit from SteppableBasePy. The __init__ method needs to call the parent class's __init__. The start method is where initializations happen, like setting up cell types and their parameters. The step method will handle actions each simulation step, like apoptosis for programmed cell death.\n\nLooking at the ontology annotations: Epithelial cells are the main cell type. The GeneOntology terms include morphogenesis, motility, adhesion, and cell death. MeSH terms add developmental biology, cell movement, simulation, epithelial cells, cell death, and adhesion. So the simulation should model epithelial cells with adhesion, movement, death, and possibly morphogenesis.\n\nIn the start method, I'll define the epithelial cell type. For adhesion, set appropriate contact energies. Volume and surface constraints are part of morphogenesis, so VolumeLocalFlex and SurfaceLocalFlex. Also, maybe lambda parameters for volume and surface. For motility, maybe a chemotaxis parameter? Or just the adhesion settings influence movement. Programmed cell death can be handled by changing a cell's target volume to induce shrinkage, then removing it when volume is below a threshold.\n\nIn the step method, check for cells that should undergo apoptosis. Maybe randomly select some cells each step and trigger death. Alternatively, use a probability. But the user didn't specify triggers, so perhaps a simple check and apply apoptosis condition.\n\nWait, in CompuCell3D, apoptosis is often handled by setting a cell's target volume to a low value and then removing it once it's small enough. So in the step method, iterate through cells, check if they are marked for death, adjust their target volume, and then remove if necessary.\n\nAlso, need to set up the contact energies between cells. For adhesion (GO:0007155), the ContactLocalProductFlex plugin manages adhesion energies between different cell types. So in the start method, set the contact energy matrix. Since there's only epithelial cells here, maybe set the same type contact energy, but perhaps also with the medium (type 0). Wait, the default medium is usually type 0. So epithelial cells (type 1) should have contact energy with medium and themselves.\n\nFor cell motility (GO:0016477), maybe adjust the lambda parameters for volume and surface to influence cell movement and shape. Higher lambda vol might make cells maintain their volume more rigidly, affecting motility.\n\nPutting this all together, the code should:\n\n- Import necessary modules.\n- Define the simulation class with init, start, step.\n- In start, define cell type, set contact energies, volume/surface parameters.\n- In step, implement cell death by checking some condition (maybe random) and then shrinking cells.\n\nLet me structure the code step by step. First, the imports. Then, the simulation class. In the start method, set up the epithelial cell type, contact energy between epithelial and medium, and configure volume, surface, and contact plugins. In the step method, iterate through cells and apply apoptosis with a certain probability. Once a cell is marked for death, set its target volume to a small value. Then, if the volume is below a threshold, delete it.\n\nWait, the user mentioned 'Programmed Cell Death (GO:0012501)', so apoptosis. So in the simulation, cells should sometimes undergo apoptosis. Maybe in the step method, each cell has a small chance each step to start apoptosis. Once triggered, the cell's target volume decreases, causing it to shrink. Once it's small enough, it's removed.\n\nSo in code:\n\nIn the start method, initialize the epithelial cell type. Set up contact energy between epithelial cells and medium. For volume and surface constraints, set lambda values. Also, set up the contact energy matrix using the ContactLocalProductFlex plugin.\n\nIn the step method, loop through all cells. For each cell, with a 0.1% chance per step, set a flag (like cell.dict['apoptosis'] = True). Then, for cells with apoptosis flag, set their target volume to 5 (or some small value). Check if their volume is below a threshold (like 2), then delete them.\n\nBut how to handle the apoptosis process. Alternatively, use the built-in apoptosis functionality in CC3D. Some steppables might have a built-in way to mark cells for death. But perhaps for simplicity, manually manage it by adjusting target volume and then removing.\n\nAlso, the cell types: the ontology mentions Epithelial Cell (CL:0000066), so the cell type should be defined as such. In CC3D, cell types are created with the cell_type attribute.\n\nSo in code:\n\nIn the start method:\n\nepithelial_type = self.cell_type_epithelial = self.new_cell_type(\"Epithelial\", 1)\n\nThen, set contact energy between epithelial and medium (type 0) and epithelial to epithelial.\n\nself.cell_contact_plugin.set_contact_energy(epithelial_type, 0, 10)\n\nself.cell_contact_plugin.set_contact_energy(epithelial_type, epithelial_type, 20)\n\nWait, but typically, lower contact energy means more adhesion. Wait, no: contact energy is like a penalty. Lower values mean cells stick together more. So for epithelial cells to adhere to each other, their contact energy should be lower than with medium. For example, epithelial-epithelial contact energy 10, epithelial-medium 20. That way, cells prefer to stick together.\n\nThen, volume and surface parameters. Using the VolumeLocalFlex plugin:\n\nself.volume_plugin = VolumeLocalFlex(\"VolumeLocalFlex\")\nself.surface_plugin = SurfaceLocalFlex(\"SurfaceLocalFlex\")\n\nThen, set target volume and lambda parameters:\n\nself.volume_plugin.set_params(25, 2, 10)  # target volume, lambda volume, maybe not sure about the exact method here. Wait, in CC3D, you usually set the target volume and lambda parameters for each cell. But maybe in the start method, set default values.\n\nAlternatively, in the start method, for each cell, set target volume and lambda.\n\nWait, perhaps in the start method, after creating cells, assign initial volume parameters. But in this example, maybe it's easier to set the parameters globally.\n\nBut in the code, maybe the VolumeLocalFlex plugin is added via the XML, but since we're doing everything in Python, perhaps using the plugins via their Python interfaces.\n\nAlternatively, using the built-in volume and surface constraints in the steppable.\n\nAlternatively, for the simulation, use the following approach:\n\nIn the start method, configure the plugins. For VolumeLocalFlex, set the target volume and lambda for the cell type. Similarly for SurfaceLocalFlex.\n\nBut I need to check the correct way to set these parameters in Python.\n\nAlternatively, in the start method, for each cell, set the targetVolume and lambdaVolume. But if all cells are of the same type, maybe set the parameters when creating the cells.\n\nWait, but perhaps in the simulation, the user is using a uniform initial setup. So in the start method, create a cell field, perhaps a blob of epithelial cells.\n\nBut the user didn't specify the initial setup. So maybe just define the cell type and parameters, and assume that cells are already present (like in a separate .xml file). However, since the code needs to be self-contained, perhaps the start method should create some cells.\n\nWait, CompuCell3D requires an initial configuration. Since the user didn't specify, perhaps the code should include creating a cell field, maybe a few cells. But in the answer, the user wants the code to be valid. So maybe create a simple 2D grid with a few cells.\n\nBut perhaps the minimal code would not include creating cells, but the user is supposed to use a separate .xml file for the initial setup. However, the problem states to return a valid simulation file, which is a Python script. So maybe the code should generate cells in the start method.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code uses the UniformInitializer to create a grid of cells.\n\nBut to keep it simple, perhaps the code includes creating a cell field with a few epithelial cells. Let's see.\n\nIn the start method:\n\nfor x in range(0, 100, 10):\n    for y in range(0, 100, 10):\n        cell = self.new_cell(\"Epithelial\")\n        self.cell_field[x, y, 0] = cell\n\nBut how to properly initialize the cells. The new_cell method creates a new cell of a specific type. Wait, in the code, after defining the epithelial cell type, we can create cells of that type.\n\nBut perhaps the code is minimal, focusing on the structure. So, in the start method, the user may create a cell or two, but maybe the code doesn't include that. However, to make it valid, perhaps some cells"

Also, the hexagonal lattice is part of epithelial structure.\n\nGeneOntology:\n- Cell adhesion (GO:0007155)\n- Programmed cell death (GO:0012501)\n- Cell motility (GO:0016477)\n- Cell morphogenesis involved in differentiation (GO:0000904) for surface area expansion.\n\nMeSH:\n- Cell Adhesion (D002448)\n- Cell Death (D016923)\n- Cell Movement (D002465)\n- Epithelial Cells (D004848)\n- Computer Simulation (D003196)\n- Developmental Biology (D002869)\n\nCheck if all terms are exact. For example, \"Cell Adhesion\" in MeSH is correct. \"Epithelial Cells\" is the term. \"Programmed Cell Death\" is part of GO as \"programmed cell death\" (GO:0012501), but the term name in GO is \"programmed cell death\". Wait, the exact term in GO is \"programmed cell death\" (GO:0012501). So in the GeneOntology section, it should be \"programmed cell death\".\n\nSo the JSON would be structured with these terms, ensuring IDs are correct and no extra spaces. Also, check that all category names are exact: CellOntology, GeneOntology, MeSH.\n\nWait, the original text mentions \"expansion of cells\u2019 apical surface areas\". For GO, maybe \"cell morphogenesis\" (GO:0000902) or \"cell morphogenesis involved in differentiation\" (GO:0000904). Let me check. GO:0000902 is \"cell morphogenesis\", which is the process. The expansion of apical surface area is part of morphogenesis, so maybe GO:0000902. Alternatively, \"cell morphogenesis involved in differentiation\" (GO:0000904) if it's part of differentiation. The text says \"expansion of cells\u2019 apical surface areas, which promoted rearrangement of neighboring cells.\" So maybe \"cell morphogenesis\" (GO:0000902).\n\nSo GeneOntology entries would be:\n- cell adhesion (GO:0007155)\n- programmed cell death (GO:0012501)\n- cell motility (GO:0016477)\n- cell morphogenesis (GO:0000902)\n\nFor MeSH, maybe also include \"Epithelium\" (D004848) as \"Epithelial Cells\" is D004848. \"Developmental Biology\" (D002869) and \"Computer Simulation\" (D003196) are relevant as the study combines simulation with experiments.\n\nPutting it all into the JSON structure, ensuring correct formatting. Now check each term and ID for accuracy.\n</think>",

      "python_code": "from cc3d.core.PySteppables import *\n\n<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file based on the provided ontology annotations. Let's start by understanding the requirements. The user wants a Python script that includes specific components: necessary imports, a simulation class inheriting from SteppableBasePy, and the __init__, start, and step methods. Also, the code should incorporate basic cell types and parameters related to the given ontologies.\n\nFirst, the imports. CompuCellSetup is essential for setting up the simulation. From the steppables module, I'll need SteppableBasePy. Also, since there's cell motility and adhesion mentioned, I should include the VolumeLocalFlex and ContactLocalProductFlex plugins. Oh, right, those are part of CompuCell's core modules, so I'll import them.\n\nNext, the simulation class. It should inherit from SteppableBasePy. The __init__ method needs to call the parent class's __init__. The start method is where initializations happen, like setting up cell types and their parameters. The step method will handle actions each simulation step, like apoptosis for programmed cell death.\n\nLooking at the ontology annotations: Epithelial cells are the main cell type. The GeneOntology terms include morphogenesis, motility, adhesion, and cell death. MeSH terms add developmental biology, cell movement, simulation, epithelial cells, cell death, and adhesion. So the simulation should model epithelial cells with adhesion, movement, death, and possibly morphogenesis.\n\nIn the start method, I'll define the epithelial cell type. For adhesion, set appropriate contact energies. Volume and surface constraints are part of morphogenesis, so VolumeLocalFlex and SurfaceLocalFlex. Also, maybe lambda parameters for volume and surface. For motility, maybe a chemotaxis parameter? Or just the adhesion settings influence movement. Programmed cell death can be handled by changing a cell's target volume to induce shrinkage, then removing it when volume is below a threshold.\n\nIn the step method, check for cells that should undergo apoptosis. Maybe randomly select some cells each step and trigger death. Alternatively, use a probability. But the user didn't specify triggers, so perhaps a simple check and apply apoptosis condition.\n\nWait, in CompuCell3D, apoptosis is often handled by setting a cell's target volume to a low value and then removing it once it's small enough. So in the step method, iterate through cells, check if they are marked for death, adjust their target volume, and then remove if necessary.\n\nAlso, need to set up the contact energies between cells. For adhesion (GO:0007155), the ContactLocalProductFlex plugin manages adhesion energies between different cell types. So in the start method, set the contact energy matrix. Since there's only epithelial cells here, maybe set the same type contact energy, but perhaps also with the medium (type 0). Wait, the default medium is usually type 0. So epithelial cells (type 1) should have contact energy with medium and themselves.\n\nFor cell motility (GO:0016477), maybe adjust the lambda parameters for volume and surface to influence cell movement and shape. Higher lambda vol might make cells maintain their volume more rigidly, affecting motility.\n\nPutting this all together, the code should:\n\n- Import necessary modules.\n- Define the simulation class with init, start, step.\n- In start, define cell type, set contact energies, volume/surface parameters.\n- In step, implement cell death by checking some condition (maybe random) and then shrinking cells.\n\nLet me structure the code step by step. First, the imports. Then, the simulation class. In the start method, set up the epithelial cell type, contact energy between epithelial and medium, and configure volume, surface, and contact plugins. In the step method, iterate through cells and apply apoptosis with a certain probability. Once a cell is marked for death, set its target volume to a small value. Then, if the volume is below a threshold, delete it.\n\nWait, the user mentioned 'Programmed Cell Death (GO:0012501)', so apoptosis. So in the simulation, cells should sometimes undergo apoptosis. Maybe in the step method, each cell has a small chance each step to start apoptosis. Once triggered, the cell's target volume decreases, causing it to shrink. Once it's small enough, it's removed.\n\nSo in code:\n\nIn the start method, initialize the epithelial cell type. Set up contact energy between epithelial cells and medium. For volume and surface constraints, set lambda values. Also, set up the contact energy matrix using the ContactLocalProductFlex plugin.\n\nIn the step method, loop through all cells. For each cell, with a 0.1% chance per step, set a flag (like cell.dict['apoptosis'] = True). Then, for cells with apoptosis flag, set their target volume to 5 (or some small value). Check if their volume is below a threshold (like 2), then delete them.\n\nBut how to handle the apoptosis process. Alternatively, use the built-in apoptosis functionality in CC3D. Some steppables might have a built-in way to mark cells for death. But perhaps for simplicity, manually manage it by adjusting target volume and then removing.\n\nAlso, the cell types: the ontology mentions Epithelial Cell (CL:0000066), so the cell type should be defined as such. In CC3D, cell types are created with the cell_type attribute.\n\nSo in code:\n\nIn the start method:\n\nepithelial_type = self.cell_type_epithelial = self.new_cell_type(\"Epithelial\", 1)\n\nThen, set contact energy between epithelial and medium (type 0) and epithelial to epithelial.\n\nself.cell_contact_plugin.set_contact_energy(epithelial_type, 0, 10)\n\nself.cell_contact_plugin.set_contact_energy(epithelial_type, epithelial_type, 20)\n\nWait, but typically, lower contact energy means more adhesion. Wait, no: contact energy is like a penalty. Lower values mean cells stick together more. So for epithelial cells to adhere to each other, their contact energy should be lower than with medium. For example, epithelial-epithelial contact energy 10, epithelial-medium 20. That way, cells prefer to stick together.\n\nThen, volume and surface parameters. Using the VolumeLocalFlex plugin:\n\nself.volume_plugin = VolumeLocalFlex(\"VolumeLocalFlex\")\nself.surface_plugin = SurfaceLocalFlex(\"SurfaceLocalFlex\")\n\nThen, set target volume and lambda parameters:\n\nself.volume_plugin.set_params(25, 2, 10)  # target volume, lambda volume, maybe not sure about the exact method here. Wait, in CC3D, you usually set the target volume and lambda parameters for each cell. But maybe in the start method, set default values.\n\nAlternatively, in the start method, for each cell, set target volume and lambda.\n\nWait, perhaps in the start method, after creating cells, assign initial volume parameters. But in this example, maybe it's easier to set the parameters globally.\n\nBut in the code, maybe the VolumeLocalFlex plugin is added via the XML, but since we're doing everything in Python, perhaps using the plugins via their Python interfaces.\n\nAlternatively, using the built-in volume and surface constraints in the steppable.\n\nAlternatively, for the simulation, use the following approach:\n\nIn the start method, configure the plugins. For VolumeLocalFlex, set the target volume and lambda for the cell type. Similarly for SurfaceLocalFlex.\n\nBut I need to check the correct way to set these parameters in Python.\n\nAlternatively, in the start method, for each cell, set the targetVolume and lambdaVolume. But if all cells are of the same type, maybe set the parameters when creating the cells.\n\nWait, but perhaps in the simulation, the user is using a uniform initial setup. So in the start method, create a cell field, perhaps a blob of epithelial cells.\n\nBut the user didn't specify the initial setup. So maybe just define the cell type and parameters, and assume that cells are already present (like in a separate .xml file). However, since the code needs to be self-contained, perhaps the start method should create some cells.\n\nWait, CompuCell3D requires an initial configuration. Since the user didn't specify, perhaps the code should include creating a cell field, maybe a few cells. But in the answer, the user wants the code to be valid. So maybe create a simple 2D grid with a few cells.\n\nBut perhaps the minimal code would not include creating cells, but the user is supposed to use a separate .xml file for the initial setup. However, the problem states to return a valid simulation file, which is a Python script. So maybe the code should generate cells in the start method.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code uses the UniformInitializer to create a grid of cells.\n\nBut to keep it simple, perhaps the code includes creating a cell field with a few epithelial cells. Let's see.\n\nIn the start method:\n\nfor x in range(0, 100, 10):\n    for y in range(0, 100, 10):\n        cell = self.new_cell(\"Epithelial\")\n        self.cell_field[x, y, 0] = cell\n\nBut how to properly initialize the cells. The new_cell method creates a new cell of a specific type. Wait, in the code, after defining the epithelial cell type, we can create cells of that type.\n\nBut perhaps the code is minimal, focusing on the structure. So, in the start method, the user may create a cell or two, but maybe the code doesn't include that. However, to make it valid, perhaps some cells",
