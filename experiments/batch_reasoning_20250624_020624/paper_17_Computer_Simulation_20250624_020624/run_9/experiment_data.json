This process of cell movements organizes the ommatidial array into a functional pattern. Unlike earlier simulations that focused on the arrangements of cells within individual ommatidia, here we examine the local movements that lead to large-scale organization of the emerging eye field. Simulations based on our experimental observations of cell adhesion, cell death, and cell movement successfully patterned a tracing of an emerging wild-type pupal eye. Surprisingly, altering cell adhesion had only a mild effect on patterning, contradicting our previous hypothesis that the patterning was primarily the result of referential adhesion between IRMclass surface proteins. Instead, our simulations highlighted the importance of programmed cell death (PCD) as well as a previously unappreciated variable: the expansion of cells\u2019 apical surface areas, which promoted rearrangement of neighboring cells. We tested this prediction experimentally by preventing expansion in the apical area of individual cells: patterning was disrupted in a manner predicted by our simulations. Our work demonstrates the value of combining computer simulation with in vivo experiments to uncover novel mechanisms that are perpetuated throughout the eye field. It also demonstrates the utility of the Glazier\u2013Graner\u2013Hogeweg model (GGH) for modeling the links between local cellular interactions and emergent properties of developing epithelia as well as predicting unanticipated results in vivo."

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by parsing the original description to identify relevant terms for each ontology category. \n\nFirst, for CellOntology, the text mentions \"glial-like support cells\" and \"epithelia\". Glial cells in Drosophila might correspond to a specific CL term. Let me check. \"Glial cell\" in Cell Ontology is CL:0000125. \"Epithelial cell\" is CL:0000066.\n\nNext, GeneOntology. The processes mentioned include cell adhesion (GO:0007155), programmed cell death (GO:0012501), cell movement (GO:0016477), and cell apical surface area expansion. For the last one, \"cell morphogenesis\" (GO:0000902) or \"cell growth\" (GO:0016049) might fit. The expansion of apical surface area could be under morphogenesis.\n\nFor MeSH terms, looking for concepts like \"Cell Death\" (D002453), \"Cell Movement\" (D002465), \"Cell Adhesion\" (D015815), and \"Epithelium\" (D004848). The simulation model mentioned is Glazier\u2013Graner\u2013Hogeweg (GGH), but MeSH might not have a specific term for that, so maybe not included.\n\nNeed to ensure IDs are correctly formatted without spaces. Check each term's exact name. For example, \"Programmed Cell Death\" is the term for GO:0012501. \"Cell adhesion\" in GO is \"Cell adhesion\" (GO:0007155). For MeSH, \"Cell Death\" is D002453, \"Cell Movement\" is D002465, \"Cell Adhesion\" is D015815, and \"Epithelium\" is D004848.\n\nDouble-checking term names and IDs against the respective ontologies to avoid errors. Make sure all terms are correctly capitalized and without extra spaces. For example, \"Epithelial\" in CellOntology is \"epithelial cell\", but the term name should be \"Epithelial cell\". Wait, the user's example used \"Epithelial\" as the term, but the actual term might have \"cell\" in it. Wait, the user's example shows \"Epithelial\" as the term, but maybe the actual CL term is \"epithelial cell\". But the user's example says to use the exact term name. Let me confirm: Cell Ontology entry CL:0000066 is \"epithelial cell\". However, the example given by the user has \"Epithelial\" without \"cell\". Should I follow the user's example or the actual term? The user's instructions say \"Term names must be exact without extra spaces\". So I need to use the exact term from the ontology. Therefore, \"epithelial cell\" for CL:0000066. But the original text mentions \"developing epithelia\", so maybe \"epithelial cell\" is appropriate. Similarly, \"glial cell\" for CL:0000125.\n\nWait, the original text refers to \"glial-like support cells\". The closest CL term might be \"glial cell\" (CL:0000125). So that's correct.\n\nFor GeneOntology terms: \"cell adhesion\" (GO:0007155), \"programmed cell death\" (GO:0012501), \"cell motility\" (GO:0016477), and \"cell morphogenesis\" (GO:0000902) for the apical expansion. Alternatively, \"cell growth\" (GO:0016049) if it's about size increase. But the text says \"expansion of cells\u2019 apical surface areas, which promoted rearrangement of neighboring cells\", which is more about shape change, so morphogenesis might be better.\n\nFor MeSH, \"Cell Death\" (D002453), \"Cell Movement\" (D002465), \"Cell Adhesion\" (D015815), and \"Epithelium\" (D004848). \n\nNow, compiling all into the JSON structure as per the user's example. Ensure category names are exact: CellOntology, GeneOntology, MeSH. Check IDs for correct formatting, no spaces. Terms are exact. Make sure arrays are properly enclosed.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000125\",\n            \"term\": \"glial cell\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000066\",\n            \"term\": \"epithelial cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007155\",\n            \"term\": \"cell adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0012501\",\n            \"term\": \"programmed cell death\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0016477\",\n            \"term\": \"cell motility\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0000902\",\n            \"term\": \"cell morphogenesis\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002453\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Death\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002465\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Movement\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D015815\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D004848\",\n            \"term\": \"Epithelium\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"

The step method defines actions each simulation step.\n\nLooking at the ontology annotations, there are two cell types: epithelial and glial cells. I'll need to define these in the start method using self.cellType. Then, the GeneOntology terms include morphogenesis, adhesion, death, and motility. MeSH terms also relate to adhesion, movement, epithelium, and cell death. So the simulation should include parameters related to adhesion, cell death (maybe using a plugin like Apoptosis), and motility (like Chemotaxis).\n\nIn the start method, I should set up the cell types.

For motility, perhaps add a chemical field and chemotaxis parameters for glial cells.\n\nWait, the user mentioned basic parameters based on the ontology.
