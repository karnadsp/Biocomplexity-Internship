This process of cell movements organizes the ommatidial array into a functional pattern. Unlike earlier simulations that focused on the arrangements of cells within individual ommatidia, here we examine the local movements that lead to large-scale organization of the emerging eye field. Simulations based on our experimental observations of cell adhesion, cell death, and cell movement successfully patterned a tracing of an emerging wild-type pupal eye. Surprisingly, altering cell adhesion had only a mild effect on patterning, contradicting our previous hypothesis that the patterning was primarily the result of referential adhesion between IRMclass surface proteins. Instead, our simulations highlighted the importance of programmed cell death (PCD) as well as a previously unappreciated variable: the expansion of cells\u2019 apical surface areas, which promoted rearrangement of neighboring cells. We tested this prediction experimentally by preventing expansion in the apical area of individual cells: patterning was disrupted in a manner predicted by our simulations. Our work demonstrates the value of combining computer simulation with in vivo experiments to uncover novel mechanisms that are perpetuated throughout the eye field. It also demonstrates the utility of the Glazier\u2013Graner\u2013Hogeweg model (GGH) for modeling the links between local cellular interactions and emergent properties of developing epithelia as well as predicting unanticipated results in vivo."

The main categories are CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH. \n\nFirst, CellOntology. The study mentions glial-like support cells. Looking up Cell Ontology, \"glial cell\" is CL:0000125. Also, epithelial cells are involved, so CL:0000066 for epithelial cell.\n\nNext, GeneOntology. The processes described include cell adhesion (GO:0007155), programmed cell death (GO:0012501), cell movement (GO:0016477), and cell surface receptor signaling (GO:0007166) because of the mention of IRM class proteins. Also, pattern specification in the eye is GO:0007456.\n\nFor MeSH terms, cell adhesion is D002448, apoptosis is D017209, cell movement is D002465, and epithelial cells are D004848. Also, computer simulation is D003196, and Drosophila is D004331.\n\nNeed to ensure all IDs are correctly formatted without spaces, and terms are exact.
