This process of cell movements organizes the ommatidial array into a functional pattern. Unlike earlier simulations that focused on the arrangements of cells within individual ommatidia, here we examine the local movements that lead to large-scale organization of the emerging eye field. Simulations based on our experimental observations of cell adhesion, cell death, and cell movement successfully patterned a tracing of an emerging wild-type pupal eye. Surprisingly, altering cell adhesion had only a mild effect on patterning, contradicting our previous hypothesis that the patterning was primarily the result of referential adhesion between IRMclass surface proteins. Instead, our simulations highlighted the importance of programmed cell death (PCD) as well as a previously unappreciated variable: the expansion of cells\u2019 apical surface areas, which promoted rearrangement of neighboring cells. We tested this prediction experimentally by preventing expansion in the apical area of individual cells: patterning was disrupted in a manner predicted by our simulations. Our work demonstrates the value of combining computer simulation with in vivo experiments to uncover novel mechanisms that are perpetuated throughout the eye field. It also demonstrates the utility of the Glazier\u2013Graner\u2013Hogeweg model (GGH) for modeling the links between local cellular interactions and emergent properties of developing epithelia as well as predicting unanticipated results in vivo."

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out how to create the JSON object with the correct ontology annotations based on the provided information.\n\nFirst, the original description talks about glial-like support cells in the Drosophila pupal eye. So I need to find the appropriate Cell Ontology term for these cells. Glial cells in Drosophila are probably under a specific CL term. Let me check. I recall that glial cells in insects might be CL:0000123, which is \"glial cell\". The term should be \"glial cell\", so that's one entry for CellOntology.\n\nNext, the process involves cell adhesion, cell death, and cell movement. For Gene Ontology, cell adhesion would be GO:0007155 (cell adhesion), programmed cell death is GO:0012501 (programmed cell death), and cell movement could be GO:0016477 (cell migration). Also, the expansion of apical surface areas might relate to cell morphogenesis, so GO:0000902 (cell morphogenesis). These should go under GeneOntology.\n\nFor MeSH terms, the study involves computer simulation, so \"Computer Simulation\" is D003198. Also, the model mentioned is the Glazier\u2013Graner\u2013Hogeweg model, which is a type of computational model, so \"Models, Biological\" would be D008957. The eye development aspect could be covered under \"Eye\" D005123, but the specific process here is about the development of the eye's epithelial structure, so maybe \"Epithelial Cells\" D004848. Wait, but the MeSH terms should be as per the text. The study is about epithelial development, so \"Epithelium\" D004848? Let me confirm. Epithelial cells are D004848, but the term is \"Epithelial Cells\". Wait, the MeSH term for Epithelial Cells is D004848. Yes. Also, the eye development might be D005123. But the main focus here is the epithelial patterning, so \"Epithelial Cells\" is appropriate. Also, \"Cell Movement\" is D002465. The study mentions cell movement as a key factor, so that should be included. So MeSH entries would be Computer Simulation (D003198), Models, Biological (D008957), Epithelial Cells (D004848), and Cell Movement (D002465).\n\nI need to ensure all the terms are spelled exactly as per the ontologies. Also, check the IDs for correctness. Let me verify each one:\n\nCellOntology: \"glial cell\" is CL:0000123. Correct.\n\nGeneOntology:\n- Cell adhesion: GO:0007155\n- Programmed cell death: GO:0012501\n- Cell migration: GO:0016477\n- Cell morphogenesis: GO:0000902\n\nMeSH:\n- Computer Simulation: D003198\n- Models, Biological: D008957\n- Epithelial Cells: D004848\n- Cell Movement: D002465\n\nYes, these all seem correct. I should structure them into the JSON as specified, without any extra spaces or formatting issues. Make sure the category names are exact, like \"CellOntology\" with no space, same for others. Also, check that the IDs have no spaces and the terms are correctly capitalized without extra spaces.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000123\",\n            \"term\": \"glial cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007155\",\n            \"term\": \"cell adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0012501\",\n            \"term\": \"programmed cell death\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0016477\",\n            \"term\": \"cell migration\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0000902\",\n            \"term\": \"cell morphogenesis\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D003198\",\n            \"term\": \"Computer Simulation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D008957\",\n            \"term\": \"Models, Biological\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D004848\",\n            \"term\": \"Epithelial Cells\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002465\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Movement\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"
