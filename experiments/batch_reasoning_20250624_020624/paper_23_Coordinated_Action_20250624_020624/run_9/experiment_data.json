      "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a CompuCell3D simulation Python file based on the given ontology annotations. Let's start by recalling the structure of a typical CompuCell3D script.\n\nFirst, the necessary imports: CompuCellSetup and the steppables module. Then, a simulation class that inherits from SteppableBasePy. The class should have __init__, start, and step methods. The ontology annotations mention two cell types: Epithelial and Mesenchymal. So, I'll define those cell types.\n\nLooking at the GeneOntology terms, there's a focus on signaling pathways like Wnt, Notch, Ephrin, and processes like cell adhesion. This suggests I should set up adhesion parameters, maybe some chemotaxis for signaling, and possibly volume constraints. The MeSH terms include gastrulation and somitogenesis, which might relate to cell movement and segmentation, so perhaps some motility parameters.\n\nIn the start method, I'll initialize the cell types with their respective properties. For adhesion, I'll use the built-in adhesion modules. The step method can adjust cell target volumes or apply directional movement based on signaling. Also, since there's cell-cell adhesion, I should configure contact energies between the cell types.\n\nWait, I need to make sure the contact energy is set correctly between epithelial and mesenchymal cells. Also, maybe set up a chemotaxis field for the Wnt signaling pathway. Let me include a concentration field for that. Oh, and in the step method, apply chemotaxis towards that field for the appropriate cell types.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Imports: CompuCellSetup, steppables, and maybe some modules like ppf or fields.\n2. Simulation class inheriting from SteppableBasePy.\n3. In __init__, call the parent constructor.\n4. In start, initialize cell types (epithelial and mesenchymal), set their adhesion parameters, contact energies, and maybe target volume and lambda.\n5. Create a chemical field for Wnt signaling.\n6. In step, maybe change target volume over time or apply chemotaxis each step.\n7. Also, configure the simulation with appropriate parameters like motility, adhesion strength, etc.\n\nNeed to check the syntax for setting up contact energy. That's usually done in the simulator's XML, but since the user wants everything in Python, maybe use the ContactLocalFlexPlugin or set it via the steppable.\n\nWait, in CompuCell3D, contact energy is typically configured via plugins in the XML. But if the user wants all in Python, perhaps the code uses the getElementWrapper methods to adjust parameters. Alternatively, maybe the code skips that and focuses on other aspects like chemotaxis and volume.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code sets up basic cell types and some parameters but relies on default plugins. Hmm, the user asked to include basic cell types and parameters based on the ontology. So perhaps include adhesion energy parameters in the start method.\n\nAlso, for cell adhesion (GO:0098609), setting adhesion parameters is essential. So, in the start method, after defining cell types, set the adhesion parameters using self.cellType[cellType].adhesion = ... or similar.\n\nWait, I'm not sure about the exact syntax. In CompuCell, you can set adhesion energy between cell types using the Contact plugin. But how to do that via Python? Maybe through the simulator object.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code uses the Potts model parameters, like setting neighbor order, and then for adhesion, it's part of the energy calculations. But I might need to set contact energies between cell types.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the FlexibleDiffusionSolverFE for chemical fields. For chemotaxis, use the Chemotaxis plugin. Let's include a chemical field for Wnt, and have cells chemotax along it.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- Imports include CompuCellSetup, steppables, and perhaps cc3d.CompuCellSetup for initializing the simulation.\n\nWait, the standard template is:\n\nfrom cc3d.core.PyCoreSpecs import *\nimport cc3d.CompuCellSetup as CompuCellSetup\n\nBut maybe the user expects the older syntax. Alternatively, the code might use the standard imports.\n\nWait, the user said \"Return ONLY the Python code without any additional text\". So I need to generate the code that defines the simulation with the required elements.\n\nHere's a possible structure:\n\nimport sys\nfrom cc3d import CompuCellSetup\nfrom cc3d.core.PyCoreSpecs import *\n\nThen, define the simulation class. But perhaps the user is expecting the older style with a Steppable class. Let me check the older CompuCell3D syntax.\n\nIn older versions, you create a class that inherits from SteppableBasePy and overrides start and step.\n\nSo:\n\nfrom cc3d.CompuCellSetup import *\nfrom cc3d.core.PySteppables import *\n\nclass SimulationSteppable(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, _simulator, _frequency=1):\n        super().__init__(_simulator, _frequency)\n\n    def start(self):\n        # Define cell types here\n        self.Epithelial = self.new_cell_type(\"Epithelial\")\n        self.Mesenchymal = self.new_cell_type(\"Mesenchymal\")\n        # Set contact energies\n        self.cell_type_contact_energy[self.Epithelial][self.Mesenchymal] = 15\n        # Other parameters like target volume, lambda volume, chemotaxis\n        for cell in self.cell_list:\n            if cell.type == self.Epithelial:\n                cell.targetVolume = 25\n                cell.lambdaVolume = 2.0\n            elif cell.type == self.Mesenchymal:\n                cell.targetVolume = 16\n                cell.lambdaVolume = 2.0\n        # Setup chemical field\n        self.create_chemical_field(\"Wnt\")\n\n    def step(self, mcs):\n        # Apply chemotaxis or adjust parameters each step\n        for cell in self.cell_list:\n            if cell.type == self.Mesenchymal:\n                cell.chemotaxisLambda[\"Wnt\"] = 0.1\n                cell.chemotaxisDirection[\"Wnt\"] = 1.0  # Move towards higher concentration\n\nBut wait, how exactly to set up the chemical field and chemotaxis? Maybe using the Chemotaxis plugin. The code would need to add the plugin and configure it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code uses the XML configuration for some parts, but the user wants all in Python. Maybe the code includes adding the necessary plugins via Python.\n\nAlternatively, use the newer core specifications approach. For example, creating a CC3DSimulation object and adding specifications.\n\nBut given the user's example in the answer, they might expect the older steppables approach. Let me proceed with that.\n\nSo the code would look something like:\n\nfrom cc3d.CompuCellSetup import *\nfrom cc3d.core.PySteppables import *\n\nclass SimulationSteppable(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, simulator, frequency=1):\n        SteppableBasePy.__init__(self, simulator, frequency)\n        self.Epithelial = None\n        self.Mesenchymal = None\n\n    def start(self):\n        self.Epithelial = self.add_cell_type(\"Epithelial\")\n        self.Mesenchymal = self.add_cell_type(\"Mesenchymal\")\n\n        # Set contact energy between cell types\n        self.cell_type_contact_energy[self.Epithelial][self.Mesenchymal] = 15\n\n        # Configure volume parameters\n        self.set_volume_parameters(self.Epithelial, target_volume=25, lambda_volume=2.0)\n        self.set_volume_parameters(self.Mesenchymal, target_volume=16, lambda_volume=2.0)\n\n        # Setup Wnt chemical field and chemotaxis\n        self.add_chemical_field(\"Wnt\")\n        self.add_chemotaxis(self.Mesenchymal, \"Wnt\", lambda_=0.1, direction=1.0)\n\n    def step(self, mcs):\n        # Update chemical field or adjust parameters each step\n        pass\n\ndef configure_simulation():\n    from cc3d.core.XMLUtils import ElementCC3D\n    cc3d = ElementCC3D(\"CompuCell3D\")\n    # Potts section\n    potts = cc3d.ElementCC3D(\"Potts\")\n    potts.ElementCC3D(\"Dimensions\", {\"x\": 100, \"y\": 100, \"z\": 1})\n    potts.ElementCC3D(\"Steps\", {}, 1000)\n    potts.ElementCC3D(\"Temperature\", {}, 10)\n    potts.ElementCC3D(\"NeighborOrder\", {}, 2)\n\n    # CellType plugin\n    cell_type = cc3d.ElementCC3D(\"Plugin\", {\"Name\": \"CellType\"})\n    cell_type.ElementCC3D(\"CellType\", {\"TypeName\": \"Epithelial\", \"TypeId\": \"0\"})\n    cell_type.ElementCC3D(\"CellType\", {\"TypeName\": \"Mesenchymal\", \"TypeId\": \"1\"})\n\n    # Contact plugin\n    contact = cc3d.ElementCC3D(\"Plugin\", {\"Name\": \"Contact\"})\n    contact.ElementCC3D(\"Energy\", {\"Type1\": \"Epithelial\", \"Type2\": \"Epithelial\"}, 10)\n    contact.ElementCC3D(\"Energy\", {\"Type1\": \"Epithelial\", \"Type2\": \"Mesenchymal\"}, 15)\n"

The code would need to add the plugin and configure it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code uses the XML configuration for some parts, but the user wants all in Python. Maybe the code includes adding the necessary plugins via Python.\n\nAlternatively, use the newer core specifications approach. For example, creating a CC3DSimulation object and adding specifications.\n\nBut given the user's example in the answer, they might expect the older steppables approach. Let me proceed with that.\n\nSo the code would look something like:\n\nfrom cc3d.CompuCellSetup import *\nfrom cc3d.core.PySteppables import *\n\nclass SimulationSteppable(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, simulator, frequency=1):\n        SteppableBasePy.__init__(self, simulator, frequency)\n        self.Epithelial = None\n        self.Mesenchymal = None\n\n    def start(self):\n        self.Epithelial = self.add_cell_type(\"Epithelial\")\n        self.Mesenchymal = self.add_cell_type(\"Mesenchymal\")\n\n        # Set contact energy between cell types\n        self.cell_type_contact_energy[self.Epithelial][self.Mesenchymal] = 15\n\n        # Configure volume parameters\n        self.set_volume_parameters(self.Epithelial, target_volume=25, lambda_volume=2.0)\n        self.set_volume_parameters(self.Mesenchymal, target_volume=16, lambda_volume=2.0)\n\n        # Setup Wnt chemical field and chemotaxis\n        self.add_chemical_field(\"Wnt\")\n        self.add_chemotaxis(self.Mesenchymal, \"Wnt\", lambda_=0.1, direction=1.0)\n\n    def step(self, mcs):\n        # Update chemical field or adjust parameters each step\n        pass\n\ndef configure_simulation():\n    from cc3d.core.XMLUtils import ElementCC3D\n    cc3d = ElementCC3D(\"CompuCell3D\")\n    # Potts section\n    potts = cc3d.ElementCC3D(\"Potts\")\n    potts.ElementCC3D(\"Dimensions\", {\"x\": 100, \"y\": 100, \"z\": 1})\n    potts.ElementCC3D(\"Steps\", {}, 1000)\n    potts.ElementCC3D(\"Temperature\", {}, 10)\n    potts.ElementCC3D(\"NeighborOrder\", {}, 2)\n\n    # CellType plugin\n    cell_type = cc3d.ElementCC3D(\"Plugin\", {\"Name\": \"CellType\"})\n    cell_type.ElementCC3D(\"CellType\", {\"TypeName\": \"Epithelial\", \"TypeId\": \"0\"})\n    cell_type.ElementCC3D(\"CellType\", {\"TypeName\": \"Mesenchymal\", \"TypeId\": \"1\"})\n\n    # Contact plugin\n    contact = cc3d.ElementCC3D(\"Plugin\", {\"Name\": \"Contact\"})\n    contact.ElementCC3D(\"Energy\", {\"Type1\": \"Epithelial\", \"Type2\": \"Epithelial\"}, 10)\n    contact.ElementCC3D(\"Energy\", {\"Type1\": \"Epithelial\", \"Type2\": \"Mesenchymal\"}, 15)",
