In this paper, we use computer simulations of chick somitogenesis to show that experimentally-observed temporal and spatial patterns of adhesive N-CAM and N-cadherin and repulsive EphA4\u2013ephrinB2 pairs suffice to reproduce the complex dynamic morphological changes of somitogenesis in wild-type and N-cadherin (?/?) chick, including intersomitic separation, boundary-shape evolution and sorting of misdifferentiated cells across compartment boundaries. Since different models of determination yield the same, experimentally-observed, distribution of adhesion and repulsion molecules, the patterning is independent of the details of this mechanism."

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by breaking down the original description to identify relevant terms for each ontology category. \n\nFirst, CellOntology. The text mentions mesenchymal cells and epithelialize. So mesenchymal cells would be under CellOntology. The process of epithelializing suggests epithelial cells. Checking Cell Ontology, I need the exact term. Mesenchymal cell is CL:0008019, and epithelial cell is CL:0000066.\n\nNext, GeneOntology. The processes involved here include somitogenesis, which is GO:0001756. There's mention of cell adhesion, so cell adhesion is GO:0007155. Also, Notch signaling pathway is GO:0007219, Wnt signaling pathway is GO:0016055, and FGF receptor signaling is GO:0008543. These should all be included under GeneOntology.\n\nFor MeSH terms, the main concepts are somitogenesis (MeSH D060885), presomitic mesoderm (MeSH D055495), and Ephrin-B2 (MeSH C109019). Also, N-CAM (which is Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule, MeSH D017207) and N-cadherin (MeSH D019086). \n\nNow, need to ensure the IDs are correct without spaces and terms are exact. Let me verify each term and ID:\n\nCellOntology:\n- Mesenchymal cell: CL:0008019\n- Epithelial cell: CL:0000066\n\nGeneOntology:\n- Somitogenesis: GO:0001756\n- Cell adhesion: GO:0007155\n- Notch signaling: GO:0007219\n- Wnt signaling: GO:0016055\n- FGF receptor signaling: GO:0008543\n\nMeSH:\n- Somitogenesis: D060885\n- Presomitic mesoderm: D055495\n- Ephrin-B2: C109019\n- N-CAM: D017207\n- N-cadherin: D019086\n\nCheck if the terms are correctly spelled and formatted. Yes. Now, structure them into the JSON as per the example. Make sure the category names are exact, no extra spaces. Ensure the IDs are properly formatted. Double-check all entries. Looks good. That should cover all the necessary terms from the text.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0008019\",\n            \"term\": \"Mesenchymal cell\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000066\",\n            \"term\": \"Epithelial cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0001756\",\n            \"term\": \"Somitogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007155\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007219\",\n            \"term\": \"Notch signaling pathway\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0016055\",\n            \"term\": \"Wnt signaling pathway\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0008543\",\n            \"term\": \"Fibroblast growth factor receptor signaling pathway\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D060885\",\n            \"term\": \"Somitogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D055495\",\n            \"term\": \"Presomitic Mesoderm\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"C109019\",\n            \"term\": \"Ephrin-B2\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D017207\",\n            \"term\": \"Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D019086\",\n            \"term\": \"N-Cadherin\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants a CompuCell3D simulation file based on specific ontology annotations. I need to generate Python code that includes the required imports, a simulation class inheriting from SteppableBasePy, and the necessary methods: __init__, start, and step. Also, I have to incorporate the given CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH terms into the simulation parameters.\n\nFirst, I'll start with the imports. CompuCellSetup is essential for setting up the simulation. The steppables module is needed for creating steppable classes. So, I'll import those.\n\nNext, the simulation class. It should inherit from steppables.SteppableBasePy. The __init__ method needs to call the parent's __init__ method. The start method is where I'll initialize cell types and set up the simulation parameters. The step method will handle actions each simulation step, maybe checking for conditions like cell volume.\n\nLooking at the CellOntology, there are Epithelial and Mesenchymal cells. I'll define these cell types in the start method using self.cellTypeDict. Assigning their colors there too.\n\nFor the GeneOntology terms, the pathways like Wnt, Notch, FGF signaling, and cell adhesion are mentioned. These can be translated into simulation parameters. Maybe I'll create a dictionary in the start method that holds parameters for each cell type related to these pathways. For example, adhesion parameters for cell adhesion (GO:0007155), and signaling strengths for the other pathways.\n\nThe MeSH terms include N-Cadherin, Ephrin-B2, Neural CAMs, which are related to adhesion. Presomitic Mesoderm and somitogenesis suggest processes during development. The somitogenesis terms might influence cell behaviors like differentiation or migration. So, in the step method, I could iterate over cells and apply some changes based on these parameters. For example, check if a cell's volume is below a threshold and change its type to mesenchymal, simulating EMT or similar processes.\n\nI should also set up the simulation dimensions and the core CompuCell3D components like the Potts model, cell field, and simulator. The Potts model parameters (dimensions, steps, temperature, neighbor order) need to be defined in the start method.\n\nWait, in CompuCell3D, the start method is where you typically set up initial conditions. So creating cell types, assigning properties, maybe even initial cells. But since the user didn't specify initial cell layout, maybe just setting the types and parameters is enough.\n\nPutting it all together: the code starts with imports, defines the SimulationSteppable class with __init__, start, and step methods. In start, cell types are declared, parameters for each type related to the ontology terms are set. In step, check cell volumes and maybe change type, adjust adhesion based on parameters.\n\nI need to make sure that all the required elements are included. The core CompuCellSetup registration is done by adding the steppable with CompuCellSetup.register_steppable. The Potts model setup includes dimensions and basic parameters.\n\nAlso, the MeSH terms like N-Cadherin and Ephrin-B2 relate to adhesion molecules, so their parameters could influence cell adhesion. The parameters dictionary in the start method can hold these values, and in the step method, apply them to cell properties, like adhesion.\n\nTesting if the code is valid: it should run without syntax errors, define the necessary classes and methods, and use CompuCell3D's API correctly.
