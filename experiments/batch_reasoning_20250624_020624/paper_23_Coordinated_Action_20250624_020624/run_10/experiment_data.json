In the prevailing clock-and-wavefront model of somitogenesis, periodic gene expression, particularly of Notch and Wnt, interacts with an FGF8-based thresholding mechanism to determine cell fates. However, this model does not explain how cell determination and subsequent differentiation translates into somite morphology. In this paper, we use computer simulations of chick somitogenesis to show that experimentally-observed temporal and spatial patterns of adhesive N-CAM and N-cadherin and repulsive EphA4\u2013ephrinB2 pairs suffice to reproduce the complex dynamic morphological changes of somitogenesis in wild-type and N-cadherin (?/?) chick, including intersomitic separation, boundary-shape evolution and sorting of misdifferentiated cells across compartment boundaries. Since different models of determination yield the same, experimentally-observed, distribution of adhesion and repulsion molecules, the patterning is independent of the details of this mechanism."

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a structured JSON object with ontology annotations based on the provided biological description. The main challenge is to correctly identify and categorize terms from Cell Ontology (CL), Gene Ontology (GO), and MeSH. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the original description thoroughly. The key terms mentioned include mesenchymal cells, presomitic mesoderm (PSM), somites, somitogenesis, Notch, Wnt, FGF8, N-CAM, N-cadherin, EphA4, ephrinB2, and terms like epithelialize, cell determination, differentiation, adhesion, repulsion.\n\nStarting with CellOntology. The text mentions mesenchymal cells and epithelialization. The correct CL terms would be \"Mesenchymal Cell\" (CL:0008019) and \"Epithelial Cell\" (CL:0000066). The presomitic mesoderm is a structure, so CL:0007006 for Presomitic Mesoderm. Somites are mentioned, so CL:0002322 for Somite.\n\nNext, GeneOntology. Processes involved include somitogenesis (GO:0001756), cell adhesion (GO:0007155), cell-cell adhesion (GO:0098609), cell differentiation (GO:0030154), and morphogenesis (GO:0009653). The molecules mentioned like Notch, Wnt, FGF8, N-CAM (GO:0005886 for plasma membrane part), N-cadherin (GO:0005886), EphA4, ephrinB2 are involved in these processes. Also, cell-cell adhesion via plasma membrane adhesion molecules (GO:0098742) and cell fate determination (GO:0001709) are relevant.\n\nFor MeSH terms, the main topics are Somites (D013001), Gastrulation (D018815), Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (D059093), Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (D058750), and Cell Adhesion (D015815). \n\nI need to ensure all IDs are correctly formatted without spaces. For example, CL:0008019, not CL: 0008019. Check each term against their respective ontologies to confirm IDs. Also, verify MeSH terms for accuracy, like D058750 for Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition. Make sure not to include any extra terms outside the provided description. Avoid any typos in term names, like \"Epithelial\" vs. \"Epithelial Cell\". \n\nFinally, structure the JSON exactly as per the example, with categories named precisely and arrays of objects with id and term. No explanations, just the JSON.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0008019\",\n            \"term\": \"Mesenchymal Cell\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000066\",\n            \"term\": \"Epithelial Cell\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0007006\",\n            \"term\": \"Presomitic Mesoderm\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0002322\",\n            \"term\": \"Somite\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0001756\",\n            \"term\": \"Somitogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007155\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0098609\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell-Cell Adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0030154\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Differentiation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0009653\",\n            \"term\": \"Morphogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0005886\",\n            \"term\": \"Plasma Membrane\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0098742\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell-Cell Adhesion via Plasma Membrane Adhesion Molecules\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0001709\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Fate Determination\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D013001\",\n            \"term\": \"Somites\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D018815\",\n            \"term\": \"Gastrulation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D059093\",\n            \"term\": \"Mesenchymal Stromal Cells\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D058750\",\n            \"term\": \"Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D015815\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Adhesion\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"
