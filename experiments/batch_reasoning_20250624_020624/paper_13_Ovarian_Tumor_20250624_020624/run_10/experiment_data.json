      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me start by reading the user's query carefully. They want me to create a JSON object with ontology annotations based on the provided information about ovarian cancer relapse and the study described. The ontologies needed are CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH. The instructions are strict about formatting: exact category names, correct IDs without spaces, and term names without extra spaces.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original description to identify relevant terms. The study mentions SKOV3.ip1 ovarian cancer cells. I remember that SKOV3 is a cell line, so for CellOntology, maybe \"Cancer cell\" or \"Ovarian cancer cell\". Checking Cell Ontology, the term \"Ovarian cancer cell\" exists with CL ID. Let me verify: CL:0001063 is for ovarian cancer cell. That should go under CellOntology.\n\nNext, the study discusses homotypic adhesion, invasion, chemotaxis, and vascularization. For GeneOntology, terms like \"Cell-cell adhesion\" (GO:0098609), \"Invasion\" might be GO:0030023 (mesenchymal cell migration involved in invasion), \"Chemotaxis\" (GO:0030595), \"Angiogenesis\" (GO:0001525). Also, \"response to hypoxia\" is mentioned, so GO:0001666 (response to hypoxia). But wait, the study says simulations suggest angiogenesis is triggered without hypoxia, so maybe hypoxia is still relevant as a contrast. Also, \"tumor growth\" could be GO:0008283 (cell population proliferation). Need to check exact terms.\n\nFor MeSH terms, the study involves peritoneal cavity, xenograft models, tumor microenvironment, neovascularization. MeSH terms like \"Peritoneal Cavity\" (D010537), \"Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays\" (D059748), \"Tumor Microenvironment\" (D059028), \"Neovascularization, Pathologic\" (D018352), and \"Cell Adhesion\" (D015815). Also, \"Ovarian Neoplasms\" (D010051) since it's about ovarian cancer.\n\nI need to ensure that the IDs are correctly formatted without spaces. For example, MeSH terms start with D followed by numbers. For Gene Ontology, terms like cell-cell adhesion is GO:0098609. Also, the term names must be exact. \"Cell-cell adhesion\" with a hyphen, not \"Cell adhesion\".\n\nWait, in the example, the user used \"Cell Division\" as a term. So capitalization is important. The term \"Cell-cell adhesion\" in GO is written as \"cell-cell adhesion\" with lowercase, but the example uses title case. Hmm, but the user's instructions say term names must be exact. So I need to check the actual term names in the ontologies.\n\nWait, checking GO:0007155 (cell adhesion) but in the study, they mention homotypic adhesion. Maybe GO:0098742 (homophilic cell adhesion via plasma membrane adhesion molecules). Or maybe \"Cell-cell adhesion\" (GO:0016337). Wait, need to verify the exact term. Alternatively, \"Cell adhesion\" (GO:0007155) is a broader term. The study emphasizes homotypic adhesion, but if there's a specific term for that, it should be used. But maybe the user just wants the broader term if the exact term isn't present. Alternatively, the term \"Cell-cell adhesion\" (GO:0098609) which is the process of adhesion between two cells. That seems appropriate.\n\nAlso, vascularization: \"angiogenesis\" (GO:0001525) is correct. Chemotaxis is GO:0030595 (chemotaxis). Invasion could be part of cell migration, maybe \"Cell migration involved in invasion\" (GO:0030023). The study talks about invasion into tissues, so that term fits.\n\nFor MeSH, \"Peritoneal Cavity\" is D010537. \"Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays\" is D059748. \"Tumor Microenvironment\" D059028. \"Neovascularization, Pathologic\" D018352. \"Cell Adhesion\" D015815. \"Ovarian Neoplasms\" D010051.\n\nSo compiling all that, the JSON should have:\n\nCellOntology: Ovarian cancer cell (CL:0001063)\n\nGeneOntology: Cell-cell adhesion (GO:0098609), Chemotaxis (GO:0030595), Angiogenesis (GO:0001525), Response to hypoxia (GO:0001666), Cell population proliferation (GO:0008283), maybe Invasion as GO:0030023?\n\nWait, the study mentions invasion into the architecture. The term \"Cell migration involved in invasion\" (GO:0030023) is a child term of \"Cell migration\". So perhaps that's more accurate. Also, the simulations look at tumor growth, so cell population proliferation (GO:0008283) would fit.\n\nMeSH: Peritoneal Cavity (D010537), Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays (D059748), Tumor Microenvironment (D059028), Neovascularization, Pathologic (D018352), Cell Adhesion (D015815), Ovarian Neoplasms (D010051).\n\nI need to make sure all terms are correctly capitalized and IDs are formatted without spaces. Also, check that each term is present in the respective ontology. For example, \"Ovarian cancer cell\" in Cell Ontology is CL:0001063. Yes. For Gene Ontology, \"response to hypoxia\" is GO:0001666. \"Cell population proliferation\" is GO:0008283.\n\nSo the final JSON should have these entries under each category, ensuring that the structure matches the example, with arrays of objects containing id and term.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0001063\",\n            \"term\": \"Ovarian cancer cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0098609\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell-cell adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0030595\",\n            \"term\": \"Chemotaxis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0001525\",\n            \"term\": \"Angiogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0001666\",\n            \"term\": \"Response to hypoxia\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0008283\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell population proliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0030023\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell migration involved in invasion\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D010537\",\n            \"term\": \"Peritoneal Cavity\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D059748\",\n            \"term\": \"Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D059028\",\n            \"term\": \"Tumor Microenvironment\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D018352\",\n            \"term\": \"Neovascularization, Pathologic\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D015815\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D010051\",\n            \"term\": \"Ovarian Neoplasms\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```"

Basic cell types and parameters based on the ontology annotations",
      "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file based on the given ontology annotations. Let me start by recalling the structure of a typical CompuCell3D Python script.\n\nFirst, the required imports. The user mentioned CompuCellSetup and steppables, so I'll import those. Also, since there's a need for cell types and parameters related to the ontology, I'll include the necessary modules like cc3d and random.\n\nNext, the simulation class. It should inherit from steppables.SteppableBasePy. The __init__ method needs to call the parent class's __init__. The start method is where the initial cells are set up. The step method will handle processes that occur each simulation step.\n\nLooking at the ontology annotations: the cell type is ovarian cancer cells. The biological processes include cell adhesion, angiogenesis, migration, response to hypoxia, chemotaxis, and proliferation. The MeSH terms mention the peritoneal cavity, tumor microenvironment, pathologic neovascularization, etc.\n\nI'll need to define the cell type in the start method. Probably using self.cell_type with the appropriate type name. Then set up basic parameters like adhesion (from cell-cell adhesion ontology), maybe volume parameters for proliferation (since proliferation involves growth), and possibly some chemotaxis parameters for migration and invasion.\n\nIn the start method, creating a cluster of cells in the center makes sense to model a tumor. Using a line of cells for initial placement. Then, each step could involve checking conditions related to hypoxia and triggering angiogenesis or chemotaxis. For example, if a cell's energy is low (simulating hypoxia), they might secrete a chemical that promotes angiogenesis. Also, cells could move towards a chemical gradient (chemotaxis).\n\nI'll include a basic chemical field for chemotaxis, say 'VEGF' since it's involved in angiogenesis. In the step method, I'll loop through each cell and apply some logic: if the cell's energy is below a threshold, increase secretion of VEGF. Then apply chemotaxis towards higher VEGF concentrations. Also, set the target volume for proliferation, maybe increasing it over time or based on conditions.\n\nWait, in CompuCell3D, chemotaxis is usually handled via the PDE solver and the steppable. Maybe I need to set up a chemical field and a chemotaxis plugin. But since the user asked for the code to include the basic setup, perhaps I need to add the chemotaxis parameters in the XML. But since the user wants the Python code, maybe the chemical field is defined there. Hmm, but the code needs to be self-contained. Alternatively, use the FlexibleDiffusionSolverFE for the chemical field.\n\nWait, the code must be valid. So I need to make sure that all necessary components are included. Let me structure it step by step.\n\nImports: CompuCellSetup, steppables, cc3d, random.\n\nThen, the CompuCell3DSimulation class. In the start method, initialize cells. Maybe create a tumor cluster. Use self.pixel_to_um to set dimensions. Then, in the step method, handle cell behaviors like proliferation, chemotaxis, and response to hypoxia.\n\nFor cell adhesion, set the adhesion parameters in the contact plugin. But how to do that in Python? Maybe in the XML, but the user wants the Python code. Alternatively, the adhesion is handled via the contact energy in the simulation. Wait, in the Python code, you can set up the contact plugin by adding contact energies between cell types. So in the start method, using self.get_xml_element('Contact') and setting the energy values there.\n\nWait, perhaps I should include the contact plugin configuration. But the user specified to return only the Python code. So maybe the contact energies are set in the XML part of the simulation, but the user wants everything in Python. Alternatively, CompuCell3D allows setting up plugins via the Python interface.\n\nWait, the code example should include the necessary setup. Let me check. The standard way to set up contact energies is via XML, but in the Python script, you can access the plugins. For example, contact_plugin = self.get_contact_plugin(), then set the contact energy between cell types.\n\nSo, in the start method, after initializing the cells, I can get the contact plugin and set the adhesion parameters. For example:\n\ncontact_plugin = self.get_contact_plugin()\ncontact_plugin.set_contact_energy(\"Tumor\", \"Medium\", 30)\ncontact_plugin.set_contact_energy(\"Tumor\", \"Tumor\", 20)\n\nBut the ontology mentions ovarian cancer cells, so maybe the cell type is named \"OvarianCancer\". Let me adjust that.\n\nAlso, for proliferation, each cell's target volume can be set in the step method. Maybe starting with a target volume and increasing it over time to simulate growth.\n\nFor angiogenesis and chemotaxis, perhaps the cells secrete a chemoattractant, and other cells (like endothelial) migrate towards it. But the ontology mentions angiogenesis as part of the simulation. However, the code may need to model this via chemical fields. Let me include a VEGF field using FlexibleDiffusionSolverFE and have the cancer cells secrete VEGF under hypoxic conditions.\n\nBut how to set up the diffusion solver in Python? Maybe through the XML, but again, the user wants the Python code. Alternatively, in the simulation class, we can add the necessary solvers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code should include the setup for diffusion and chemotaxis. Let me see. The user might expect that the code includes the necessary components to model the mentioned ontologies, even if simplified.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nImports: CompuCellSetup, steppables, cc3d, random.\n\nThen, the simulation class. In __init__, call parent __init__. In start, set up cell types, initial cells, contact energies. In step, handle cell behaviors.\n\nHere's a possible code structure:\n\nimport sys\nfrom cc3d import CompuCellSetup\nfrom cc3d.core.PySteppables import *\n\nclass OvarianCancerSimulation(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, frequency=1):\n        super().__init__(frequency)\n        \n    def start(self):\n        # Set up cell types\n        self.cell_type = self.new_cell_type(\"OvarianCancerCell\")\n        \n        # Configure contact energies\n        contact_plugin = self.get_contact_plugin()\n        contact_plugin.set_contact_energy(\"OvarianCancerCell\", \"OvarianCancerCell\", 20)\n        contact_plugin.set_contact_energy(\"OvarianCancerCell\", \"Medium\", 30)\n        \n        # Initialize tumor cells\n        for _ in range(100):\n            x = random.randint(20, 80)\n            y = random.randint(20, 80)\n            z = 0\n            cell = self.potts.createCell()\n            cell.type = self.cell_type\n            self.cell_field[x, y, z] = cell\n        \n        # Setup fields for angiogenesis and chemotaxis\n        self.create_chemical_field(\"VEGF\")\n        \n    def step(self, mcs):\n        # Proliferation\n        for cell in self.cell_list:\n            if cell.type == self.cell_type:\n                cell.targetVolume += 0.1  # Simulate growth\n                cell.lambdaVolume = 2.0\n                \n        # Response to hypoxia and angiogenesis\n        for cell in self.cell_list:\n            if cell.type == self.cell_type:\n                # Assume hypoxia when volume is high\n                if cell.volume > 50:\n                    self.chemical_field.VEGF[cell.xCOM, cell.yCOM, cell.zCOM] += 10  # Secrete VEGF\n                    \n        # Chemotaxis\n        chemotaxis_plugin = self.get_chemotaxis_plugin()\n        chemotaxis_plugin.add_chemotaxis_data(cell.type, \"VEGF\", 10.0)\n\ndef configure_simulation():\n    from cc3d.core.XMLUtils import ElementCC3D\n    cc3d = ElementCC3D(\"CompuCell3D\")\n    \n    # Set up Potts\n    potts = cc3d.ElementCC3D(\"Potts\")\n    potts.ElementCC3D(\"Dimensions\", {\"x\": 100, \"y\": 100, \"z\": 1})\n    potts.ElementCC3D(\"Steps\", {}, 1000)\n    potts.ElementCC3D(\"Temperature\", {}, 10)\n    potts.ElementCC3D(\"NeighborOrder\", {}, 2)\n    \n    # Add plugins\n    volume_plugin = cc3d.ElementCC3D(\"Plugin\", {\"Name\": \"Volume\"})\n    contact_plugin = cc3d.ElementCC3D(\"Plugin\", {\"Name\": \"Contact\"})\n    chemotaxis_plugin = cc3d.ElementCC3D(\"Plugin\", {\"Name\": \"Chemotaxis\"})\n    \n    # Add cell types\n    cell_type_elem = cc3d.ElementCC3D(\"Plugin\", {\"Name\": \"CellType\"})\n    cell_type_elem.ElementCC3D(\"CellType\", {\"TypeName\": \"Medium\", \"TypeId\": \"0\"})\n    cell_type_elem.ElementCC3D(\"CellType\", {\"TypeName\": \"OvarianCancerCell\", \"TypeId\": \"1\"})\n    \n    # VEGF diffusion\n    diffusion_solver = cc3d.ElementCC3D(\"Steppable\", {\"Type\": \""

So I need to check the actual term names in the ontologies.\n\nWait, checking GO:0007155 (cell adhesion) but in the study, they mention homotypic adhesion. Maybe GO:0098742 (homophilic cell adhesion via plasma membrane adhesion molecules). Or maybe \"Cell-cell adhesion\" (GO:0016337). Wait, need to verify the exact term. Alternatively, \"Cell adhesion\" (GO:0007155) is a broader term. The study emphasizes homotypic adhesion, but if there's a specific term for that, it should be used. But maybe the user just wants the broader term if the exact term isn't present. Alternatively, the term \"Cell-cell adhesion\" (GO:0098609) which is the process of adhesion between two cells. That seems appropriate.\n\nAlso, vascularization: \"angiogenesis\" (GO:0001525) is correct. Chemotaxis is GO:0030595 (chemotaxis). Invasion could be part of cell migration, maybe \"Cell migration involved in invasion\" (GO:0030023). The study talks about invasion into tissues, so that term fits.\n\nFor MeSH, \"Peritoneal Cavity\" is D010537. \"Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays\" is D059748. \"Tumor Microenvironment\" D059028. \"Neovascularization, Pathologic\" D018352. \"Cell Adhesion\" D015815. \"Ovarian Neoplasms\" D010051.\n\nSo compiling all that, the JSON should have:\n\nCellOntology: Ovarian cancer cell (CL:0001063)\n\nGeneOntology: Cell-cell adhesion (GO:0098609), Chemotaxis (GO:0030595), Angiogenesis (GO:0001525), Response to hypoxia (GO:0001666), Cell population proliferation (GO:0008283), maybe Invasion as GO:0030023?\n\nWait, the study mentions invasion into the architecture. The term \"Cell migration involved in invasion\" (GO:0030023) is a child term of \"Cell migration\". So perhaps that's more accurate. Also, the simulations look at tumor growth, so cell population proliferation (GO:0008283) would fit.\n\nMeSH: Peritoneal Cavity (D010537), Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays (D059748), Tumor Microenvironment (D059028), Neovascularization, Pathologic (D018352), Cell Adhesion (D015815), Ovarian Neoplasms (D010051).\n\nI need to make sure all terms are correctly capitalized and IDs are formatted without spaces. Also, check that each term is present in the respective ontology. For example, \"Ovarian cancer cell\" in Cell Ontology is CL:0001063. Yes. For Gene Ontology, \"response to hypoxia\" is GO:0001666. \"Cell population proliferation\" is GO:0008283.\n\nSo the final JSON should have these entries under each category, ensuring that the structure matches the example, with arrays of objects containing id and term.\n</think>",

      "python_code": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file based on the given ontology annotations. Let me start by recalling the structure of a typical CompuCell3D Python script.\n\nFirst, the required imports. The user mentioned CompuCellSetup and steppables, so I'll import those. Also, since there's a need for cell types and parameters related to the ontology, I'll include the necessary modules like cc3d and random.\n\nNext, the simulation class. It should inherit from steppables.SteppableBasePy. The __init__ method needs to call the parent class's __init__. The start method is where the initial cells are set up. The step method will handle processes that occur each simulation step.\n\nLooking at the ontology annotations: the cell type is ovarian cancer cells. The biological processes include cell adhesion, angiogenesis, migration, response to hypoxia, chemotaxis, and proliferation. The MeSH terms mention the peritoneal cavity, tumor microenvironment, pathologic neovascularization, etc.\n\nI'll need to define the cell type in the start method. Probably using self.cell_type with the appropriate type name. Then set up basic parameters like adhesion (from cell-cell adhesion ontology), maybe volume parameters for proliferation (since proliferation involves growth), and possibly some chemotaxis parameters for migration and invasion.\n\nIn the start method, creating a cluster of cells in the center makes sense to model a tumor. Using a line of cells for initial placement. Then, each step could involve checking conditions related to hypoxia and triggering angiogenesis or chemotaxis. For example, if a cell's energy is low (simulating hypoxia), they might secrete a chemical that promotes angiogenesis. Also, cells could move towards a chemical gradient (chemotaxis).\n\nI'll include a basic chemical field for chemotaxis, say 'VEGF' since it's involved in angiogenesis. In the step method, I'll loop through each cell and apply some logic: if the cell's energy is below a threshold, increase secretion of VEGF. Then apply chemotaxis towards higher VEGF concentrations. Also, set the target volume for proliferation, maybe increasing it over time or based on conditions.\n\nWait, in CompuCell3D, chemotaxis is usually handled via the PDE solver and the steppable. Maybe I need to set up a chemical field and a chemotaxis plugin. But since the user asked for the code to include the basic setup, perhaps I need to add the chemotaxis parameters in the XML. But since the user wants the Python code, maybe the chemical field is defined there. Hmm, but the code needs to be self-contained. Alternatively, use the FlexibleDiffusionSolverFE for the chemical field.\n\nWait, the code must be valid. So I need to make sure that all necessary components are included. Let me structure it step by step.\n\nImports: CompuCellSetup, steppables, cc3d, random.\n\nThen, the CompuCell3DSimulation class. In the start method, initialize cells. Maybe create a tumor cluster. Use self.pixel_to_um to set dimensions. Then, in the step method, handle cell behaviors like proliferation, chemotaxis, and response to hypoxia.\n\nFor cell adhesion, set the adhesion parameters in the contact plugin. But how to do that in Python? Maybe in the XML, but the user wants the Python code. Alternatively, the adhesion is handled via the contact energy in the simulation. Wait, in the Python code, you can set up the contact plugin by adding contact energies between cell types. So in the start method, using self.get_xml_element('Contact') and setting the energy values there.\n\nWait, perhaps I should include the contact plugin configuration. But the user specified to return only the Python code. So maybe the contact energies are set in the XML part of the simulation, but the user wants everything in Python. Alternatively, CompuCell3D allows setting up plugins via the Python interface.\n\nWait, the code example should include the necessary setup. Let me check. The standard way to set up contact energies is via XML, but in the Python script, you can access the plugins. For example, contact_plugin = self.get_contact_plugin(), then set the contact energy between cell types.\n\nSo, in the start method, after initializing the cells, I can get the contact plugin and set the adhesion parameters. For example:\n\ncontact_plugin = self.get_contact_plugin()\ncontact_plugin.set_contact_energy(\"Tumor\", \"Medium\", 30)\ncontact_plugin.set_contact_energy(\"Tumor\", \"Tumor\", 20)\n\nBut the ontology mentions ovarian cancer cells, so maybe the cell type is named \"OvarianCancer\". Let me adjust that.\n\nAlso, for proliferation, each cell's target volume can be set in the step method. Maybe starting with a target volume and increasing it over time to simulate growth.\n\nFor angiogenesis and chemotaxis, perhaps the cells secrete a chemoattractant, and other cells (like endothelial) migrate towards it. But the ontology mentions angiogenesis as part of the simulation. However, the code may need to model this via chemical fields. Let me include a VEGF field using FlexibleDiffusionSolverFE and have the cancer cells secrete VEGF under hypoxic conditions.\n\nBut how to set up the diffusion solver in Python? Maybe through the XML, but again, the user wants the Python code. Alternatively, in the simulation class, we can add the necessary solvers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code should include the setup for diffusion and chemotaxis. Let me see. The user might expect that the code includes the necessary components to model the mentioned ontologies, even if simplified.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nImports: CompuCellSetup, steppables, cc3d, random.\n\nThen, the simulation class. In __init__, call parent __init__. In start, set up cell types, initial cells, contact energies. In step, handle cell behaviors.\n\nHere's a possible code structure:\n\nimport sys\nfrom cc3d import CompuCellSetup\nfrom cc3d.core.PySteppables import *\n\nclass OvarianCancerSimulation(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, frequency=1):\n        super().__init__(frequency)\n        \n    def start(self):\n        # Set up cell types\n        self.cell_type = self.new_cell_type(\"OvarianCancerCell\")\n        \n        # Configure contact energies\n        contact_plugin = self.get_contact_plugin()\n        contact_plugin.set_contact_energy(\"OvarianCancerCell\", \"OvarianCancerCell\", 20)\n        contact_plugin.set_contact_energy(\"OvarianCancerCell\", \"Medium\", 30)\n        \n        # Initialize tumor cells\n        for _ in range(100):\n            x = random.randint(20, 80)\n            y = random.randint(20, 80)\n            z = 0\n            cell = self.potts.createCell()\n            cell.type = self.cell_type\n            self.cell_field[x, y, z] = cell\n        \n        # Setup fields for angiogenesis and chemotaxis\n        self.create_chemical_field(\"VEGF\")\n        \n    def step(self, mcs):\n        # Proliferation\n        for cell in self.cell_list:\n            if cell.type == self.cell_type:\n                cell.targetVolume += 0.1  # Simulate growth\n                cell.lambdaVolume = 2.0\n                \n        # Response to hypoxia and angiogenesis\n        for cell in self.cell_list:\n            if cell.type == self.cell_type:\n                # Assume hypoxia when volume is high\n                if cell.volume > 50:\n                    self.chemical_field.VEGF[cell.xCOM, cell.yCOM, cell.zCOM] += 10  # Secrete VEGF\n                    \n        # Chemotaxis\n        chemotaxis_plugin = self.get_chemotaxis_plugin()\n        chemotaxis_plugin.add_chemotaxis_data(cell.type, \"VEGF\", 10.0)\n\ndef configure_simulation():\n    from cc3d.core.XMLUtils import ElementCC3D\n    cc3d = ElementCC3D(\"CompuCell3D\")\n    \n    # Set up Potts\n    potts = cc3d.ElementCC3D(\"Potts\")\n    potts.ElementCC3D(\"Dimensions\", {\"x\": 100, \"y\": 100, \"z\": 1})\n    potts.ElementCC3D(\"Steps\", {}, 1000)\n    potts.ElementCC3D(\"Temperature\", {}, 10)\n    potts.ElementCC3D(\"NeighborOrder\", {}, 2)\n    \n    # Add plugins\n    volume_plugin = cc3d.ElementCC3D(\"Plugin\", {\"Name\": \"Volume\"})\n    contact_plugin = cc3d.ElementCC3D(\"Plugin\", {\"Name\": \"Contact\"})\n    chemotaxis_plugin = cc3d.ElementCC3D(\"Plugin\", {\"Name\": \"Chemotaxis\"})\n    \n    # Add cell types\n    cell_type_elem = cc3d.ElementCC3D(\"Plugin\", {\"Name\": \"CellType\"})\n    cell_type_elem.ElementCC3D(\"CellType\", {\"TypeName\": \"Medium\", \"TypeId\": \"0\"})\n    cell_type_elem.ElementCC3D(\"CellType\", {\"TypeName\": \"OvarianCancerCell\", \"TypeId\": \"1\"})\n    \n    # VEGF diffusion\n    diffusion_solver = cc3d.ElementCC3D(\"Steppable\", {\"Type\": \"",
