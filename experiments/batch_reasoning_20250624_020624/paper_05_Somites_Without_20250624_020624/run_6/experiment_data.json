Interaction of this oscillator with a wave traveling along the body axis (the clock-and-wavefront model) is generally believed to control somite number, size, and axial identity. Here we show that a clock-and-wavefront mechanism is unnecessary for somite formation. Non-somite mesoderm treated with Noggin generates many somites that form simultaneously, without cyclic expression of Notch-pathway genes, yet have normal size, shape, and fate. These somites have axial identity: The Hox code is fixed independently of somite fate. However, these somites are not subdivided into rostral and caudal halves, which is necessary for neural segmentation. We propose that somites are self-organizing structures whose size and shape is controlled by local cell-cell interactions."

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants a JSON object with ontology annotations based on the provided biological description. The main categories are CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH, each with exact IDs and terms.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original description. Key points include somite formation, molecular oscillations (segmentation clock), clock-and-wavefront model, Notch-pathway genes, Hox code, and Noggin treatment.\n\nFor CellOntology, the terms mentioned are somites and non-somite mesoderm. Checking Cell Ontology, \"Somite\" is CL:0002322. \"Mesenchymal cell\" from mesoderm might be relevant, CL:0008019.\n\nGeneOntology: The processes here include somite development (GO:0061053), segmentation (GO:0007386), cell-cell signaling (GO:0007267), and Notch signaling pathway (GO:0007219). Also, Hox code relates to pattern specification (GO:0007389). Noggin's role is in BMP signaling (GO:0030509).\n\nMeSH terms: Somites (D019577), Embryonic Development (D000077198), Notch Receptors (D015326), Hox Genes (D042104), and BMP proteins (D049109). The clock-and-wavefront model might be under Embryonic Development.\n\nCheck the exact IDs and terms. Ensure no extra spaces, correct formatting. Avoid duplicates. For example, \"Somite\" in both CellOntology and MeSH, but they are different ontologies. Also, verify MeSH IDs like D000077198 for Embryonic Development.\n\nWait, MeSH D000077198 is \"Embryonic Development\". The segmentation clock is part of that. Hox Genes are D042104, BMP proteins D049109. Notch Receptors D015326. The clock-and-wavefront model isn't a MeSH term, so maybe just use Embryonic Development.\n\nDouble-check each term's existence in their respective ontologies. For instance, \"Hox code\" isn't a standard term, but Hox Genes (MeSH D042104) and pattern specification (GO:0007389) for axial identity.\n\nFinally, structure the JSON without explanations, following the exact category names and IDs.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0002322\",\n            \"term\": \"Somite\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0008019\",\n            \"term\": \"Mesenchymal cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0061053\",\n            \"term\": \"Somite development\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007386\",\n            \"term\": \"Segmentation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007267\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell-cell signaling\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007219\",\n            \"term\": \"Notch signaling pathway\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007389\",\n            \"term\": \"Pattern specification process\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0030509\",\n            \"term\": \"BMP signaling pathway\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D019577\",\n            \"term\": \"Somites\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D000077198\",\n            \"term\": \"Embryonic Development\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D015326\",\n            \"term\": \"Notch Receptors\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D042104\",\n            \"term\": \"Hox Genes\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D049109\",\n            \"term\": \"Bone Morphogenetic Proteins\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"
