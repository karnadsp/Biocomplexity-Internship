Interaction of this oscillator with a wave traveling along the body axis (the clock-and-wavefront model) is generally believed to control somite number, size, and axial identity. Here we show that a clock-and-wavefront mechanism is unnecessary for somite formation. Non-somite mesoderm treated with Noggin generates many somites that form simultaneously, without cyclic expression of Notch-pathway genes, yet have normal size, shape, and fate. These somites have axial identity: The Hox code is fixed independently of somite fate. However, these somites are not subdivided into rostral and caudal halves, which is necessary for neural segmentation. We propose that somites are self-organizing structures whose size and shape is controlled by local cell-cell interactions."

      "response": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this. The user wants a JSON object with ontology annotations based on the provided biological description. They specified CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH categories with exact IDs and terms.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original description. The main focus is on somite formation, the segmentation clock, and related genes and processes. \n\nFor CellOntology, the text mentions somites and non-somite mesoderm. The term \"Somite\" should correspond to CL:0000003. Also, \"Mesenchymal Cell\" from CL:0008019 might be relevant since mesoderm is involved.\n\nIn GeneOntology, the segmentation clock involves molecular oscillations, so \"segmentation clock\" (GO:0042733) is a must. Notch pathway genes are mentioned, so \"Notch signaling pathway\" (GO:0007219). Hox genes are discussed for axial identity, so \"Hox gene\" (GO:0000977). Noggin is used, which is a BMP antagonist, so \"BMP signaling pathway\" (GO:0030509) and \"protein binding\" (GO:0005515) since Noggin binds proteins. Also, \"somite development\" (GO:0061053) and \"cell-cell adhesion\" (GO:0098609) for local interactions.\n\nFor MeSH, \"Somites\" (D019170) is obvious. The clock-and-wavefront model might be under \"Developmental Biology\" (D002684). Hox genes relate to \"Body Patterning\" (D001828). BMP and Notch pathways would fall under \"Signal Transduction\" (D015398). \"Embryo, Vertebrate\" (D065088) as the context is vertebrate embryos.\n\nNeed to ensure all IDs are correctly formatted without spaces. Check each term's exact name and ID against the respective ontologies.

The class must have __init__, start, and step methods.\n\nLooking at the ontology annotations, the cell types are Somite and MesenchymalCell.

For example, setting adhesion parameters based on cell-cell adhesion (GO:0098609). Maybe BMP and Notch signaling pathways (GO terms) can be modeled by adding secretion or absorption of certain chemicals. The segmentation clock (GO:0042733) might involve a periodic process, so in the step method, I could adjust a variable periodically to simulate clock oscillations.\n\nMeSH terms include body patterning and developmental biology aspects, so perhaps setting up initial conditions that reflect somite development stages.

In the step method, maybe adjust the chemical concentrations based on the clock. Also, periodically check conditions to simulate somite formation steps.\n\nLet me structure the code step by step. Imports, then the steppable class. In start, define cell types and their adhesion, volume, etc. Add a chemical field. In step, handle the segmentation clock by using a modulo on the step number to trigger events, like changing cell properties or secreting chemicals. BMP and Notch pathways can be modeled by having cells secrete substances that others absorb, affecting their behavior.\n\nNeed to make sure all required methods are present: __init__ calls super, start initializes, step runs each frame.
