This is an artifact in the CPM. An analysis of the CPM reveals an explicit inverse-relationship between the cell stiffness and motility parameters. We use this relationship to compensate for motility-induced changes in cell size in the CPM so that in the corrected CPM, cell size is independent of the cell motility. We find that subject to comparable levels of compression, clusters of motile cells grow faster than clusters of less motile cells, in qualitative agreement with biological observations and our previous study. Increasing compression tends to reduce growth rates. Contact inhibition penalizes clumped cells by halting their growth and gives motile cells an even greater advantage.

      "response": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this ontology annotation task. The user wants me to create a JSON object with structured annotations based on the provided biological modeling description. They specified using CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH terms where applicable.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original description carefully. The study focuses on tumor cell clusters, cell migration, motility, compression, contact inhibition, growth rates, and the Cellular Potts Model (CPM). There's mention of neuroblastoma cells in culture conditions. \n\nStarting with CellOntology. The text talks about tumor cells, so \"Malignant cell\" (CL:0001034) is relevant. Neuroblastoma cells are mentioned, which are a type of neuron-related cancer cell. The CL term for \"Neuroblast\" is CL:0000037, but since they're cultured and malignant, maybe \"Neural crest cell\" (CL:0000603) is more appropriate? Wait, neuroblastoma originates from neural crest cells. But checking CL, \"Neuroblastoma cell line\" might be a better fit. However, CL doesn't have a specific term for neuroblastoma cell line. The closest might be \"Malignant cell\" again. Alternatively, \"Neural cell\" (CL:0002319) but that's too broad. Maybe stick with CL:0001034 for Malignant cell.\n\nNext, GeneOntology. The study involves cell migration, so terms like \"cell migration\" (GO:0016477). Cell motility is a related term, but GO:0016477 is the correct one. There's mention of cell proliferation and growth rates. \"Cell population proliferation\" is GO:0008283. Contact inhibition is discussed, which relates to \"regulation of cell population proliferation\" (GO:0040007). Also, cell size regulation: \"regulation of cell size\" (GO:0008361). The CPM model's artifact about cell stiffness and motility might relate to \"cell stiffness\" (GO:0048260) and \"cell motility\" (GO:0016477 again). Wait, GO:0048260 is \"regulation of cell migration\", but the term \"cell stiffness\" isn't in GO. Maybe \"cell morphogenesis\" (GO:0000902) or \"cell shape\" (GO:0016049)? Alternatively, \"cell motility\" (GO:0016477) and \"cell compression\" might not have a direct GO term. Let me verify. \"Cell motility\" is correct as GO:0016477. For compression, perhaps \"response to mechanical stimulus\" (GO:0009612). But the study's focus is on the effects of compression on growth, so maybe \"negative regulation of cell growth\" (GO:0030308) when under compression. Contact inhibition relates to \"contact inhibition\" (GO:0060242). So, include GO:0016477 (cell migration), GO:0008283 (cell proliferation), GO:0060242 (contact inhibition), and GO:0030308 (negative regulation of cell growth). Also, \"cell size\" regulation (GO:0008361).\n\nFor MeSH terms, the topics are cell movement (MeSH D002465), cell proliferation (D049109), contact inhibition (D018895), neoplasm invasiveness (D009361), and neuroblastoma (D009447). The study models tumor growth, so \"Neoplasms\" (D009369) might be relevant. Also, \"Cell Survival\" (D002470) if considering growth rates. But the description mentions cell clusters' growth rates, so \"Cell Proliferation\" (D049109) is key. \"Cell Movement\" (D002465) for motility. \"Contact Inhibition\" (D018895) directly. \"Neuroblastoma\" (D009447) as the cell type. \"Cell Size\" (D002467) is a MeSH term. Also, \"Models, Biological\" (D008954) since they use CPM.\n\nPutting it all together, ensuring IDs are correct and terms are exact. Check each term's existence:\n\nCellOntology:\n- Malignant cell (CL:0001034)\n- Neuroblastoma cell line isn't in CL, so maybe Neural crest cell (CL:0000603)? Wait, the original text mentions neuroblastoma cells cultured. CL has \"neuroblast\" (CL:0000037) but that's embryonic. Maybe stick with Malignant cell (CL:0001034) and \"Neural crest cell\" (CL:0000603) as neuroblastoma arises from neural crest. But the user might expect \"Neuroblastoma\" as a term. If CL doesn't have it, then maybe only CL:0001034.\n\nGeneOntology:\n- Cell migration (GO:0016477)\n- Cell population proliferation (GO:0008283)\n- Contact inhibition of cell population proliferation (GO:0060242)\n- Regulation of cell size (GO:0008361)\n- Negative regulation of cell growth (GO:0030308)\n\nMeSH:\n- Cell Movement (D002465)\n- Cell Proliferation (D049109)\n- Contact Inhibition (D018895)\n- Neuroblastoma (D009447)\n- Cell Size (D002467)\n- Models, Biological (D008954)\n\nDouble-check MeSH terms: \"Contact Inhibition\" is D018895, \"Cell Size\" D002467, yes. \"Neoplasm Invasiveness\" D009361 might be relevant, but the study is about tumor cell clusters' growth, not invasion per se. Maybe include \"Neoplasms\" D009369. But the example given in the problem includes terms directly mentioned. The original text mentions \"tumor cell clusters\", so \"Neoplasms\" (D009369) is appropriate.\n\nNow structure the JSON with exact category names and proper formatting. No extra spaces, exact IDs. Avoid any terms not explicitly mentioned. For example, \"cell motility\" is covered under \"cell migration\". \"Compression\" might not have a direct term. The model uses CPM, so \"Models, Biological\" (D008954) is a MeSH term. Ensure all terms are correctly capitalized and match the ontology entries exactly.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0001034\",\n            \"term\": \"Malignant cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0016477\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Migration\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0008283\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Population Proliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0060242\",\n            \"term\": \"Contact Inhibition\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0008361\",\n            \"term\": \"Regulation of Cell Size\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002465\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Movement\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D049109\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Proliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D018895\",\n            \"term\": \"Contact Inhibition\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D009447\",\n            \"term\": \"Neuroblastoma\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D008954\",\n            \"term\": \"Models, Biological\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file based on the given ontology annotations. Let me start by recalling the structure of a typical CompuCell3D Python script.\n\nFirst, the necessary imports. The user mentioned CompuCellSetup and steppables, so I'll import those. Also, I remember that for setting up the simulation, we usually import modules like cc3d, cc3d.CompuCellSetup, and various core modules.\n\nNext, the simulation class. It should inherit from steppables.SteppableBasePy. The required methods are __init__, start, and step. In the __init__ method, I need to call the parent class's constructor. The start method is for initial setup, like initializing cells, and the step method handles actions each simulation step.\n\nLooking at the ontology annotations:\n\n- CellOntology includes Malignant cell (CL:0001034). So, I'll define a cell type 'Malignant' in the start method.\n\nGeneOntology terms:\n- Contact Inhibition (GO:0060242): This probably relates to contact inhibition, so I should set up a volume plugin with parameters that enforce contact inhibition, maybe by adjusting target volume and lambda parameters.\n- Cell Population Proliferation (GO:0008283): Cells should divide, so I'll include mitosis (maybe using the Mitosis steppable). Also, set a division rate.\n- Cell Migration (GO:0016477): This involves cell movement, so I need to configure the flexibility of cells, perhaps using the ConnectivityGlobal plugin to allow movement without sticking too much.\n- Regulation of Cell Size (GO:0008361): Again, volume and surface constraints would be relevant here.\n\nMeSH terms:\n- Contact Inhibition (D018895): Reinforces the need for contact inhibition parameters.\n- Cell Movement (D002465): Same as migration, adjust connectivity.\n- Models, Biological (D008954): Just general simulation setup.\n- Cell Proliferation (D049109): Mitosis again.\n- Neuroblastoma (D009447): Maybe the cell type is related, but the name here is Malignant, so that's covered.\n\nNow, putting this together. In the start method, I'll set up the cell types. The malignant cells will have certain volume, surface, and contact parameters. The plugins needed are VolumeLocalFlex (for volume constraints), SurfaceLocalFlex (surface constraints), ContactLocalFlex (contact inhibition), and ConnectivityGlobal (for migration).\n\nFor proliferation, I'll use the MitosisSteppable. When a cell is ready to divide, it should split. The step method can check if a cell's volume exceeds a threshold to trigger division.\n\nWait, how to handle the division rate? Maybe using a probability in the step method. For example, each step, a cell has a 10% chance to attempt division if it's mature enough. Alternatively, track cell age. But to keep it simple, maybe check volume and then divide.\n\nIn the start method, I'll initialize cells. Maybe place some malignant cells in the center. Use a line of code like self.cell_field[10:20, 10:20, 0] = malignant_cell.\n\nThe VolumeLocalFlex plugin requires setting target volume (target_volume) and lambda_volume. Similarly for SurfaceLocalFlex and ContactLocalFlex. For ContactLocalFlex, set the contact energy between cells. Malignant cells might have lower adhesion, promoting movement.\n\nConnectivityGlobal plugin's max_neighbor_index affects how cells move. Setting it to 20 allows more flexibility.\n\nIn the MitosisSteppable, when a cell divides, the parent and child need to have their target volumes set correctly. The clone_attributes method can copy properties.\n\nI should also set up the Potts simulation parameters: dimensions, steps, neighbor order, temperature, and fluctuation amplitude.\n\nPutting all this into code:\n\nImports:\nimport cc3d\nfrom cc3d import CompuCellSetup\nfrom cc3d.core.PySteppables import *\n\nSimulation class inheriting from SteppableBasePy. In __init__, call super. Start method initializes cells and sets up plugins. Step method handles proliferation.\n\nWait, the MitosisSteppable is a separate steppable. So the main simulation class will handle initial setup, and a MitosisSteppable subclass will handle division.\n\nBut the user's instructions say to include a proper simulation class that has the required methods. Maybe they want the mitosis handling within the main class. Or perhaps split into two steppables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the main simulation class includes the mitosis logic. But typically, mitosis is handled via a separate steppable. However, to keep everything in one class, maybe integrate it.\n\nBut in the code example, the user might need to have the MitosisSteppable as a separate class. Let me check.\n\nIn CompuCell3D, when you create a mitosis event, you can use a separate steppable that monitors cell volume and triggers division. So, the main steppable's step method might check each cell's volume, and if it's above a threshold, call divide_3D(). Then, in a mitosis module, handle the actual division.\n\nAlternatively, use the built-in VolumeTracker plugin to manage cell division based on volume. But perhaps for the sake of including all in one class, handle it manually.\n\nAlternatively, create a subclass of MitosisSteppable. Let's structure it with two steppables: the main one for setup, and another for mitosis.\n\nBut the user's instruction says \"the code must include... a proper simulation class that inherits from steppables.SteppableBasePy\". So perhaps the main class includes everything. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code includes multiple steppables. But the user might expect a single class.\n\nWait, the user's code example in their mind might be something like:\n\nclass SimulationSteppable(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, ...):\n        ...\n    def start(self):\n        ...\n    def step(self, ...):\n        ...\n\nSo, maybe in the start method, set up the cell types, and in the step method, handle proliferation by checking cell volume and dividing.\n\nBut for mitosis, you need to clone the cell and manage parent and child. Using self.divide_cell_random_orientation might be the way.\n\nAlternatively, use the MitosisSteppable. Let me think.\n\nIn the step method, loop through each cell, check if volume exceeds a threshold (e.g., 50), then divide. But to avoid division every step, perhaps track cell maturity. Alternatively, set a probability.\n\nBut for simplicity, perhaps when a cell's volume is above 50, it divides. But in CompuCell3D, when you divide a cell, you need to manage the parent and child. So the code would be something like:\n\nfor cell in self.cell_list:\n    if cell.volume > 50:\n        new_cell = self.divide_cell_orientation_vector_based(cell, ...)\n        new_cell.targetVolume = 25\n        cell.targetVolume = 25\n\nBut perhaps setting the target volume in the start method for all cells. Maybe the Volume plugin will take care of adjusting the volume over time.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nImports first. Then, define the simulation class with __init__, start, step.\n\nIn start, set up the cell type 'Malignant' with volume, surface, contact parameters. Initialize cells in a region.\n\nIn step, check each cell's volume and possibly divide.\n\nSet up the plugins in start by accessing the XML elements via self.get_xml_element.\n\nBut in practice, CompuCell3D uses XML configuration, but the Python script can set parameters via the cc3d.CompuCellSetup.register_steppable method.\n\nAlternatively, the code can create a Simulator object and set parameters via the Python interface.\n\nAlternatively, the correct way is to use the self.add_steppable_to_registry(steppable) and configure plugins via the XML elements.\n\nWait, perhaps the code needs to use the XML elements to set up the plugins. For example:\n\nvolume_plugin = self.get_xml_element('Volume')\nvolume_plugin.set_energy_parameters(25, 2, ...)\n\nBut in practice, how to do this via Python?\n\nAlternatively, in the start method, access the simulator's core objects.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code uses the built-in classes to set parameters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code uses the following approach:\n\nIn the start method:\n\ncell_volume_dict = {\n    'Malignant': {'target_volume': 25, 'lambda_volume': 2.0},\n}\n\ncell_surface_dict = {\n    'Malignant': {'target_surface': 20, 'lambda_surface': 0.5},\n}\n\ncontact_energy_dict = {\n    ('Medium', 'Malignant'): 10,\n    ('Malignant', 'Malignant'): 5,\n}\n\nThen, configure the VolumeLocalFlex, SurfaceLocalFlex, ContactLocalFlex plugins.\n\nBut how to do this via Python in CompuCell3D? I think you can use the set_volume_parameters and set_surface_parameters methods.\n\nAlternatively, use the XML elements:\n\nvolume_xml = cc3d.get_element(\"Volume\")\nvolume_xml.set_parameters(25, 2.0)  # target_volume, lambda_volume\n\nBut I need to check the correct syntax.\n\nAlternatively, for each cell type, set the parameters:\n\nfor cell_type in self.cell_types:\n    self.cell"

Wait, the original text mentions neuroblastoma cells cultured. CL has \"neuroblast\" (CL:0000037) but that's embryonic. Maybe stick with Malignant cell (CL:0001034) and \"Neural crest cell\" (CL:0000603) as neuroblastoma arises from neural crest. But the user might expect \"Neuroblastoma\" as a term. If CL doesn't have it, then maybe only CL:0001034.\n\nGeneOntology:\n- Cell migration (GO:0016477)\n- Cell population proliferation (GO:0008283)\n- Contact inhibition of cell population proliferation (GO:0060242)\n- Regulation of cell size (GO:0008361)\n- Negative regulation of cell growth (GO:0030308)\n\nMeSH:\n- Cell Movement (D002465)\n- Cell Proliferation (D049109)\n- Contact Inhibition (D018895)\n- Neuroblastoma (D009447)\n- Cell Size (D002467)\n- Models, Biological (D008954)\n\nDouble-check MeSH terms: \"Contact Inhibition\" is D018895, \"Cell Size\" D002467, yes. \"Neoplasm Invasiveness\" D009361 might be relevant, but the study is about tumor cell clusters' growth, not invasion per se. Maybe include \"Neoplasms\" D009369. But the example given in the problem includes terms directly mentioned. The original text mentions \"tumor cell clusters\", so \"Neoplasms\" (D009369) is appropriate.\n\nNow structure the JSON with exact category names and proper formatting. No extra spaces, exact IDs. Avoid any terms not explicitly mentioned. For example, \"cell motility\" is covered under \"cell migration\". \"Compression\" might not have a direct term. The model uses CPM, so \"Models, Biological\" (D008954) is a MeSH term. Ensure all terms are correctly capitalized and match the ontology entries exactly.\n</think>",

      "python_code": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file based on the given ontology annotations. Let me start by recalling the structure of a typical CompuCell3D Python script.\n\nFirst, the necessary imports. The user mentioned CompuCellSetup and steppables, so I'll import those. Also, I remember that for setting up the simulation, we usually import modules like cc3d, cc3d.CompuCellSetup, and various core modules.\n\nNext, the simulation class. It should inherit from steppables.SteppableBasePy. The required methods are __init__, start, and step. In the __init__ method, I need to call the parent class's constructor. The start method is for initial setup, like initializing cells, and the step method handles actions each simulation step.\n\nLooking at the ontology annotations:\n\n- CellOntology includes Malignant cell (CL:0001034). So, I'll define a cell type 'Malignant' in the start method.\n\nGeneOntology terms:\n- Contact Inhibition (GO:0060242): This probably relates to contact inhibition, so I should set up a volume plugin with parameters that enforce contact inhibition, maybe by adjusting target volume and lambda parameters.\n- Cell Population Proliferation (GO:0008283): Cells should divide, so I'll include mitosis (maybe using the Mitosis steppable). Also, set a division rate.\n- Cell Migration (GO:0016477): This involves cell movement, so I need to configure the flexibility of cells, perhaps using the ConnectivityGlobal plugin to allow movement without sticking too much.\n- Regulation of Cell Size (GO:0008361): Again, volume and surface constraints would be relevant here.\n\nMeSH terms:\n- Contact Inhibition (D018895): Reinforces the need for contact inhibition parameters.\n- Cell Movement (D002465): Same as migration, adjust connectivity.\n- Models, Biological (D008954): Just general simulation setup.\n- Cell Proliferation (D049109): Mitosis again.\n- Neuroblastoma (D009447): Maybe the cell type is related, but the name here is Malignant, so that's covered.\n\nNow, putting this together. In the start method, I'll set up the cell types. The malignant cells will have certain volume, surface, and contact parameters. The plugins needed are VolumeLocalFlex (for volume constraints), SurfaceLocalFlex (surface constraints), ContactLocalFlex (contact inhibition), and ConnectivityGlobal (for migration).\n\nFor proliferation, I'll use the MitosisSteppable. When a cell is ready to divide, it should split. The step method can check if a cell's volume exceeds a threshold to trigger division.\n\nWait, how to handle the division rate? Maybe using a probability in the step method. For example, each step, a cell has a 10% chance to attempt division if it's mature enough. Alternatively, track cell age. But to keep it simple, maybe check volume and then divide.\n\nIn the start method, I'll initialize cells. Maybe place some malignant cells in the center. Use a line of code like self.cell_field[10:20, 10:20, 0] = malignant_cell.\n\nThe VolumeLocalFlex plugin requires setting target volume (target_volume) and lambda_volume. Similarly for SurfaceLocalFlex and ContactLocalFlex. For ContactLocalFlex, set the contact energy between cells. Malignant cells might have lower adhesion, promoting movement.\n\nConnectivityGlobal plugin's max_neighbor_index affects how cells move. Setting it to 20 allows more flexibility.\n\nIn the MitosisSteppable, when a cell divides, the parent and child need to have their target volumes set correctly. The clone_attributes method can copy properties.\n\nI should also set up the Potts simulation parameters: dimensions, steps, neighbor order, temperature, and fluctuation amplitude.\n\nPutting all this into code:\n\nImports:\nimport cc3d\nfrom cc3d import CompuCellSetup\nfrom cc3d.core.PySteppables import *\n\nSimulation class inheriting from SteppableBasePy. In __init__, call super. Start method initializes cells and sets up plugins. Step method handles proliferation.\n\nWait, the MitosisSteppable is a separate steppable. So the main simulation class will handle initial setup, and a MitosisSteppable subclass will handle division.\n\nBut the user's instructions say to include a proper simulation class that has the required methods. Maybe they want the mitosis handling within the main class. Or perhaps split into two steppables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the main simulation class includes the mitosis logic. But typically, mitosis is handled via a separate steppable. However, to keep everything in one class, maybe integrate it.\n\nBut in the code example, the user might need to have the MitosisSteppable as a separate class. Let me check.\n\nIn CompuCell3D, when you create a mitosis event, you can use a separate steppable that monitors cell volume and triggers division. So, the main steppable's step method might check each cell's volume, and if it's above a threshold, call divide_3D(). Then, in a mitosis module, handle the actual division.\n\nAlternatively, use the built-in VolumeTracker plugin to manage cell division based on volume. But perhaps for the sake of including all in one class, handle it manually.\n\nAlternatively, create a subclass of MitosisSteppable. Let's structure it with two steppables: the main one for setup, and another for mitosis.\n\nBut the user's instruction says \"the code must include... a proper simulation class that inherits from steppables.SteppableBasePy\". So perhaps the main class includes everything. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code includes multiple steppables. But the user might expect a single class.\n\nWait, the user's code example in their mind might be something like:\n\nclass SimulationSteppable(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, ...):\n        ...\n    def start(self):\n        ...\n    def step(self, ...):\n        ...\n\nSo, maybe in the start method, set up the cell types, and in the step method, handle proliferation by checking cell volume and dividing.\n\nBut for mitosis, you need to clone the cell and manage parent and child. Using self.divide_cell_random_orientation might be the way.\n\nAlternatively, use the MitosisSteppable. Let me think.\n\nIn the step method, loop through each cell, check if volume exceeds a threshold (e.g., 50), then divide. But to avoid division every step, perhaps track cell maturity. Alternatively, set a probability.\n\nBut for simplicity, perhaps when a cell's volume is above 50, it divides. But in CompuCell3D, when you divide a cell, you need to manage the parent and child. So the code would be something like:\n\nfor cell in self.cell_list:\n    if cell.volume > 50:\n        new_cell = self.divide_cell_orientation_vector_based(cell, ...)\n        new_cell.targetVolume = 25\n        cell.targetVolume = 25\n\nBut perhaps setting the target volume in the start method for all cells. Maybe the Volume plugin will take care of adjusting the volume over time.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nImports first. Then, define the simulation class with __init__, start, step.\n\nIn start, set up the cell type 'Malignant' with volume, surface, contact parameters. Initialize cells in a region.\n\nIn step, check each cell's volume and possibly divide.\n\nSet up the plugins in start by accessing the XML elements via self.get_xml_element.\n\nBut in practice, CompuCell3D uses XML configuration, but the Python script can set parameters via the cc3d.CompuCellSetup.register_steppable method.\n\nAlternatively, the code can create a Simulator object and set parameters via the Python interface.\n\nAlternatively, the correct way is to use the self.add_steppable_to_registry(steppable) and configure plugins via the XML elements.\n\nWait, perhaps the code needs to use the XML elements to set up the plugins. For example:\n\nvolume_plugin = self.get_xml_element('Volume')\nvolume_plugin.set_energy_parameters(25, 2, ...)\n\nBut in practice, how to do this via Python?\n\nAlternatively, in the start method, access the simulator's core objects.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code uses the built-in classes to set parameters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code uses the following approach:\n\nIn the start method:\n\ncell_volume_dict = {\n    'Malignant': {'target_volume': 25, 'lambda_volume': 2.0},\n}\n\ncell_surface_dict = {\n    'Malignant': {'target_surface': 20, 'lambda_surface': 0.5},\n}\n\ncontact_energy_dict = {\n    ('Medium', 'Malignant'): 10,\n    ('Malignant', 'Malignant'): 5,\n}\n\nThen, configure the VolumeLocalFlex, SurfaceLocalFlex, ContactLocalFlex plugins.\n\nBut how to do this via Python in CompuCell3D? I think you can use the set_volume_parameters and set_surface_parameters methods.\n\nAlternatively, use the XML elements:\n\nvolume_xml = cc3d.get_element(\"Volume\")\nvolume_xml.set_parameters(25, 2.0)  # target_volume, lambda_volume\n\nBut I need to check the correct syntax.\n\nAlternatively, for each cell type, set the parameters:\n\nfor cell_type in self.cell_types:\n    self.cell",
