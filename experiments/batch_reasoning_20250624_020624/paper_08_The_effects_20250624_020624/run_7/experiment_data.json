        "description": "There are numerous biological examples where genes associated with migratory ability of cells also confer the cells with an increased fitness even though these genes may not have any known effect on the cell mitosis rates. Here, we provide insight into these observations by analyzing the effects of cell migration, compression, and contact inhibition on the growth of tumor cell clusters using the Cellular Potts Model (CPM) in a monolayer geometry. This is a follow-up of a previous study (Thalhauser et al. 2010) in which a Moran-type model was used to study the interaction of cell proliferation, migratory potential and death on the emergence of invasive phenotypes. Here, we extend the study to include the effects of cell size and shape. In particular, we investigate the interplay between cell motility and compressibility within the CPM and find that the CPM predicts that increased cell motility leads to smaller cells. This is an artifact in the CPM. An analysis of the CPM reveals an explicit inverse-relationship between the cell stiffness and motility parameters. We use this relationship to compensate for motility-induced changes in cell size in the CPM so that in the corrected CPM, cell size is independent of the cell motility. We find that subject to comparable levels of compression, clusters of motile cells grow faster than clusters of less motile cells, in qualitative agreement with biological observations and our previous study. Increasing compression tends to reduce growth rates. Contact inhibition penalizes clumped cells by halting their growth and gives motile cells an even greater advantage. Finally, our model predicts cell size distributions that are consistent with those observed in clusters of neuroblastoma cells cultured in low and high density conditions."

      "response": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem. The user wants structured ontology annotations based on the provided biological modeling description. They specified CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH terms. I need to extract relevant terms from the text and map them to the correct IDs.\n\nFirst, looking at the original description. The study involves tumor cell clusters, cell migration, motility, compression, contact inhibition, cell size, shape, and the Cellular Potts Model (CPM). The previous study used a Moran-type model. The model predicts cell size distributions in neuroblastoma cells under different densities.\n\nFor CellOntology, the main cell type mentioned is neuroblastoma cells. Neuroblastoma is a type of cancer, so I need the correct CL term. Checking Cell Ontology, neuroblastoma cells are under CL:0000571. Also, tumor cell clusters might refer to neoplastic cells, which could be CL:0008032. Wait, but the example used \"Epithelial\" with a specific CL ID. Let me confirm the exact terms. \"Neuroblastoma cell\" is CL:0000571. Tumor cell cluster might be better as \"neoplastic cell\" (CL:0008032) since that's a general term for cancerous cells.\n\nNext, GeneOntology terms. The processes involved include cell migration (GO:0016477), cell motility (same as migration?), cell proliferation (GO:0008283), contact inhibition (GO:0060242). The study also talks about cell size regulation (GO:0008361) and cell shape (GO:0016049). Also, the Cellular Potts Model is a computational model, but the biological process here would be related to growth involved in morphogenesis (GO:0048638) maybe? Or perhaps more directly, cell growth (GO:0016049). Wait, cell growth is GO:0040007, but that's for cell size. Wait, checking GO:0040007 is \"cell growth\", which is the process of cell size increasing. But the study mentions cell size and shape. So cell size regulation is GO:0008361. Cell shape is GO:0008361? Wait, no. Let me check. Cell morphogenesis involved in differentiation is GO:0000904. Cell shape maintenance might be GO:0008361. Yes, \"regulation of cell size\" is GO:0008361, and \"cell morphogenesis\" is GO:0000902. Alternatively, \"cell motility\" is GO:0016477. So the terms here would include cell migration (GO:0016477), cell proliferation (GO:0008283), contact inhibition of cell proliferation (GO:0060242), cell size regulation (GO:0008361), and cell morphogenesis (GO:0000902). The study also mentions cell death, which might be apoptosis (GO:0006915), but the original text says genes associated with migratory ability don't affect mitosis rates, so maybe apoptosis isn't directly relevant here. The main processes are migration, proliferation, contact inhibition, cell size, and shape.\n\nFor MeSH terms, the topics include Cell Movement (D002465), Cell Proliferation (D049109), Contact Inhibition (D003276), Neoplasm Metastasis (D009362), and Models, Biological (D008954). The Cellular Potts Model is a computational model, so Models, Biological would fit. The study is about tumor growth, so Neoplasm Metastasis is relevant. Cell compression might relate to mechanical processes, but MeSH terms for compression? Maybe \"Cell Size\" (D002471) and \"Cell Shape\" (D002472). Wait, MeSH has \"Cell Movement\" (D002465), \"Cell Proliferation\" (D049109), \"Contact Inhibition\" (D003276), \"Neoplasms\" (D009369), \"Models, Biological\" (D008954), \"Cell Size\" (D002471), \"Cell Survival\" (D002470), and \"Neoplasm Invasiveness\" (D009361). Since the study discusses clusters of motile cells growing faster, which relates to invasiveness, so Neoplasm Invasiveness (D009361) could be another term. Also, the Cellular Potts Model is a computational model, so Models, Biological (D008954) is appropriate.\n\nNow, I need to ensure all terms are correctly spelled with exact IDs. Let's compile the JSON structure accordingly.\n\nCellOntology should have neuroblastoma cells (CL:0000571) and neoplastic cells (CL:0008032). GeneOntology includes cell migration (GO:0016477), cell proliferation (GO:0008283), contact inhibition (GO:0060242), cell size regulation (GO:0008361), and maybe cell morphogenesis (GO:0000902). MeSH terms would be Cell Movement (D002465), Cell Proliferation (D049109), Contact Inhibition (D003276), Neoplasm Invasiveness (D009361), and Models, Biological (D008954).\n\nDouble-checking IDs:\n\n- CL:0000571 is indeed \"neuroblastoma cell\".\n- CL:0008032 is \"neoplastic cell\".\n- GO:0016477 is \"cell migration\".\n- GO:0008283 is \"cell proliferation\".\n- GO:0060242 is \"contact inhibition of cell proliferation\".\n- GO:0008361 is \"regulation of cell size\".\n- GO:0000902 is \"cell morphogenesis\".\n- MeSH D002465 is \"Cell Movement\".\n- D049109 is \"Cell Proliferation\".\n- D003276 is \"Contact Inhibition\".\n- D009361 is \"Neoplasm Invasiveness\".\n- D008954 is \"Models, Biological\".\n\nWait, but MeSH has \"Contact Inhibition\" as D003276. Yes. And \"Neoplasm Invasiveness\" is D009361. The model used is Cellular Potts Model, which is a biological model, so Models, Biological (D008954) fits. Also, \"Cell Size\" as D002471 and \"Cell Shape\" as D002472 could be relevant. The study mentions cell size and shape, so including those MeSH terms might be appropriate. Let me check if those are valid. Yes, MeSH terms for Cell Size (D002471) and Cell Shape (D002472) exist. However, the original text mentions cell size distributions, so perhaps \"Cell Size\" is relevant. But the MeSH terms for Cell Size and Cell Shape should be included. However, the example only included a few terms. Maybe prioritize the most relevant ones. The study's focus is on motility, compression, contact inhibition, and their effects on growth. So the MeSH terms would include Cell Movement, Cell Proliferation, Contact Inhibition, Neoplasm Invasiveness, Models, Biological, and possibly Cell Size. Let me include Cell Size (D002471) as well.\n\nSo the final JSON would have:\n\nCellOntology: CL:0000571 (neuroblastoma cell), CL:0008032 (neoplastic cell).\n\nGeneOntology: GO:0016477 (cell migration), GO:0008283 (cell proliferation), GO:0060242 (contact inhibition of cell proliferation), GO:0008361 (regulation of cell size), and maybe GO:0000902 (cell morphogenesis). Wait, the study mentions cell shape, which is part of morphogenesis, so including that.\n\nMeSH: D002465 (Cell Movement), D049109 (Cell Proliferation), D003276 (Contact Inhibition), D009361 (Neoplasm Invasiveness), D008954 (Models, Biological), D002471 (Cell Size).\n\nBut the example only has a few entries. However, the user wants all applicable terms. So include all relevant ones.\n\nLet me verify each term's existence in their respective ontologies.\n\nCL:0000571: Yes, neuroblastoma cell.\n\nCL:0008032: Yes, neoplastic cell.\n\nGO:0016477: Correct, cell migration.\n\nGO:0008283: Correct, cell proliferation.\n\nGO:0060242: Yes, contact inhibition of cell proliferation.\n\nGO:0008361: Yes, regulation of cell size.\n\nGO:0000902: Cell morphogenesis, which is correct for cell shape changes.\n\nMeSH D002465: Cell Movement.\n\nD049109: Cell Proliferation.\n\nD003276: Contact Inhibition.\n\nD009361: Neoplasm Invasiveness.\n\nD008954: Models, Biological.\n\nD002471: Cell Size.\n\nD002472: Cell Shape.\n\nThe study mentions cell shape, so perhaps adding Cell Shape (D002472) as well.\n\nSo the MeSH terms would be Cell Movement, Cell Proliferation, Contact Inhibition, Neoplasm Invasiveness, Models, Biological, Cell Size, Cell Shape.\n\nThat's eight terms. But maybe the user wants the most relevant. However, since the study explicitly mentions cell size and shape, including those makes sense.\n\nNow, structuring the JSON exactly as per the example, ensuring no extra spaces, exact term names, and correct category names.\n\nFinal check for exact term names:\n\n- \"neuroblastoma cell\" (CL:0000571 term is \"neuroblastoma cell\").\n\n- \"neoplastic cell\" (CL:0008032 term is \"neoplastic cell\").\n\n- Gene Ontology terms: \"cell migration\", \"cell proliferation\", \"contact inhibition of cell proliferation\", \"regulation of cell size\", \"cell morphogenesis\".\n\n- MeSH terms: \"Cell Movement\", \"Cell Proliferation\", \"Contact Inhibition\", \"Neoplasm Invasiveness\", \"Models, Biological\", \"Cell Size"
