        "description": "There are numerous biological examples where genes associated with migratory ability of cells also confer the cells with an increased fitness even though these genes may not have any known effect on the cell mitosis rates. Here, we provide insight into these observations by analyzing the effects of cell migration, compression, and contact inhibition on the growth of tumor cell clusters using the Cellular Potts Model (CPM) in a monolayer geometry. This is a follow-up of a previous study (Thalhauser et al. 2010) in which a Moran-type model was used to study the interaction of cell proliferation, migratory potential and death on the emergence of invasive phenotypes. Here, we extend the study to include the effects of cell size and shape. In particular, we investigate the interplay between cell motility and compressibility within the CPM and find that the CPM predicts that increased cell motility leads to smaller cells. This is an artifact in the CPM. An analysis of the CPM reveals an explicit inverse-relationship between the cell stiffness and motility parameters. We use this relationship to compensate for motility-induced changes in cell size in the CPM so that in the corrected CPM, cell size is independent of the cell motility. We find that subject to comparable levels of compression, clusters of motile cells grow faster than clusters of less motile cells, in qualitative agreement with biological observations and our previous study. Increasing compression tends to reduce growth rates. Contact inhibition penalizes clumped cells by halting their growth and gives motile cells an even greater advantage. Finally, our model predicts cell size distributions that are consistent with those observed in clusters of neuroblastoma cells cultured in low and high density conditions."

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a CompuCell3D simulation file based on the given ontology annotations. Let me start by recalling the structure of a typical CompuCell3D Python script.\n\nFirst, the necessary imports: CompuCellSetup and the steppables module. Then, a simulation class that inherits from SteppableBasePy. The class must have __init__, start, and step methods.\n\nThe ontology annotations mention two cell types: Neuroblastoma and Malignant cells. So I should define these in the start method using self.cellType. The GeneOntology terms include proliferation, motility, migration, contact inhibition, and apoptosis. MeSH terms add cell movement, contact inhibition, proliferation, etc. So I need to set parameters related to these processes.\n\nIn the start method, I'll set up the cell types with their respective types. For each cell type, I'll assign attributes like target volume, lambda volume for volume constraint, and maybe parameters for apoptosis (like a probability) and motility (e.g., lambda chemotaxis or persistence).\n\nIn the step method, I'll handle cell behaviors each step. For proliferation, check if a cell's volume exceeds a threshold and then divide. For apoptosis, maybe a random chance to trigger cell death. Contact inhibition could involve checking neighbors and adjusting motility or growth.\n\nWait, in CompuCell3D, cell division is often handled by the Volume plugin, but maybe in the step method I can manually check volume and call divide. Also, apoptosis is typically managed by the Apoptosis plugin, but here perhaps using a simple probability to remove the cell.\n\nFor motility, setting up a chemotaxis or using a persistent walk might be necessary. But the exact implementation would depend on the plugins used. Maybe in the XML part, but since the user wants Python code, perhaps I need to set attributes related to lambda chemotaxis or others in the start method.\n\nLet me structure the code:\n\nImports: CompuCellSetup, steppables, and maybe some modules like random.\n\nSimulation class:\n\n- __init__ calls super().__init__.\n- start: initializes cell types, sets their parameters (target volume, volume lambda, apoptosis probability, motility parameters).\n- step: loop through cells, check for apoptosis (random check based on probability), check volume for division, and maybe adjust motility based on neighbors for contact inhibition.\n\nWait, contact inhibition usually affects cell division when surrounded. Maybe in the step method, check the number of neighbors and inhibit division if there are too many. But in the given parameters, maybe just adjust the motility when cells are in contact.\n\nBut how to implement contact inhibition? Perhaps by reducing motility if a cell has many neighbors. For example, if a cell has more than X neighbors, decrease its lambda chemotaxis or some other parameter.\n\nAlso, apoptosis could be a random chance each step. So in step, for each cell, generate a random number and if below apoptosis_probability, mark the cell for death.\n\nFor cell division, when the volume is above a certain threshold, split the cell. Using the divide function from the steppable.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nIn start, define the cell types with their properties. In step, loop through cells, apply apoptosis, check for division, and adjust motility based on contact (number of neighbors).\n\nI should also set the simulation steps and other parameters like dimensions in the XML, but the user only wants the Python code. However, in the code, the simulation setup might include some configuration. Wait, in CompuCell3D, the Python script often includes a line to register the steppable and setup the simulation.\n\nWait, the user's code must include the required imports, simulation class, and methods. The XML is separate, but the Python code here is part of the simulation setup.\n\nSo the code structure:\n\nimport CompuCellSetup\nfrom PySteppables import *\nimport random\n\nclass SimulationSteppable(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, simulator, _frequency=1):\n        super().__init__(simulator, _frequency)\n    \n    def start(self):\n        # Define cell types\n        self.cell_type_neuro = self.addCellType(\"Neuroblastoma\")\n        self.cell_type_malignant = self.addCellType(\"Malignant\")\n        \n        # Set parameters for each cell type\n        for cell in self.cell_list:\n            if cell.type == self.cell_type_neuro:\n                cell.targetVolume = 25\n                cell.lambdaVolume = 2.0\n                cell.apoptosis_prob = 0.001  # low apoptosis\n                cell.lambdaChemotaxis = 500  # high motility\n            elif cell.type == self.cell_type_malignant:\n                cell.targetVolume = 25\n                cell.lambdaVolume = 2.0\n                cell.apoptosis_prob = 0.01   # higher apoptosis\n                cell.lambdaChemotaxis = 1000  # even higher motility\n        \n    def step(self, mcs):\n        for cell in self.cell_list:\n            # Apoptosis\n            if random.random() < cell.apoptosis_prob:\n                cell.targetVolume = 0\n                cell.lambdaVolume = 0\n            \n            # Proliferation: if volume exceeds threshold, divide\n            if cell.volume > 30:\n                self.divideCellRandomOrientation(cell)\n            \n            # Contact inhibition: reduce motility if many neighbors\n            if len(self.getCellNeighbors(cell)) > 4:\n                cell.lambdaChemotaxis = max(100, cell.lambdaChemotaxis - 200)\n            else:\n                # Reset to original value based on type\n                if cell.type == self.cell_type_neuro:\n                    cell.lambdaChemotaxis = 500\n                else:\n                    cell.lambdaChemotaxis = 1000\n\n# Registration of the steppable\nCompuCellSetup.register_steppable(steppable=SimulationSteppable(frequency=1))\n\nWait, but in the start method, how are cells initialized? The code as written loops through self.cell_list during start, but initially, there may be no cells. So perhaps the start method is meant to set the default parameters for cell types, not existing cells. Alternatively, maybe in the start method, the user adds initial cells, but the question doesn't specify. The user's ontology mentions cell types, but the code needs to have basic parameters.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the start method sets the attributes for the cell types, not individual cells. Wait, in CompuCell3D, cell types are managed via the CellType plugin. So in the start method, you can set the parameters for each cell type, but individual cells may need their attributes set when they are created.\n\nBut the code provided in the answer may need to loop through all existing cells (if any) in start, but if it's a new simulation, maybe there are no cells. Hmm, perhaps the start method here is just defining the cell types and their properties. But the example code I've seen often uses the start method to initialize cells. However, the user's problem states \"basic cell types and parameters based on ontology\", so maybe the code defines the cell types and their default parameters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the start method is not the right place to loop through cells. Maybe the cell initialization is handled elsewhere, and the parameters are set in the XML.\n\nBut the user wants the Python code. Let me adjust. The code should define the cell types and their properties. For example, using self.addCellType(\"Neuroblastoma\") and then setting the parameters for each cell type via the simulator or via the dictionary.\n\nWait, perhaps in the start method, we can access the cell type definitions and set parameters. For example:\n\nneuro_type = self.getCellTypeById(\"Neuroblastoma\")\nneuro_type.setVolume(25, 25, 25)  # target volume, etc.\n\nBut I'm not exactly sure of the CompuCell3D API here. Alternatively, in the XML configuration, you set the target volume and lambda volume. But since the user wants the Python code, maybe in the start method, they can iterate over the cell types and set their parameters.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code uses the simulator object to set parameters. But I'm not entirely certain. Let me think again.\n\nIn CompuCell3D, cell properties like targetVolume and lambdaVolume are usually handled by the Volume plugin. These can be set per cell or globally. If the code is in Python, in the start method, you might need to loop through all cells and set their targetVolume and lambdaVolume. But if the simulation starts with cells, perhaps they are initialized elsewhere (e.g., via PIF files).\n\nBut since the user hasn't specified initial cell setup, maybe the code doesn't need to handle that. Instead, the code should define the cell types and their parameters. So perhaps in the start method, the code adds the cell types and sets up the plugins.\n\nWait, the code example provided by the user should include the necessary parts. Let me check a sample CompuCell3D Python script.\n\nA typical script would have:\n\nfrom PySteppables import *\nimport CompuCellSetup\n\nclass SimulationSteppable(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, simulator, _frequency=1):\n        SteppableBasePy.__init__(self, simulator, _frequency)\n        # Initialization code here\n\n    def start(self):\n        # Code to run at the beginning of the simulation\n        pass\n\n    def step(self, mcs):\n        # Code to"

The XML is separate, but the Python code here is part of the simulation setup.\n\nSo the code structure:\n\nimport CompuCellSetup\nfrom PySteppables import *\nimport random\n\nclass SimulationSteppable(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, simulator, _frequency=1):\n        super().__init__(simulator, _frequency)\n    \n    def start(self):\n        # Define cell types\n        self.cell_type_neuro = self.addCellType(\"Neuroblastoma\")\n        self.cell_type_malignant = self.addCellType(\"Malignant\")\n        \n        # Set parameters for each cell type\n        for cell in self.cell_list:\n            if cell.type == self.cell_type_neuro:\n                cell.targetVolume = 25\n                cell.lambdaVolume = 2.0\n                cell.apoptosis_prob = 0.001  # low apoptosis\n                cell.lambdaChemotaxis = 500  # high motility\n            elif cell.type == self.cell_type_malignant:\n                cell.targetVolume = 25\n                cell.lambdaVolume = 2.0\n                cell.apoptosis_prob = 0.01   # higher apoptosis\n                cell.lambdaChemotaxis = 1000  # even higher motility\n        \n    def step(self, mcs):\n        for cell in self.cell_list:\n            # Apoptosis\n            if random.random() < cell.apoptosis_prob:\n                cell.targetVolume = 0\n                cell.lambdaVolume = 0\n            \n            # Proliferation: if volume exceeds threshold, divide\n            if cell.volume > 30:\n                self.divideCellRandomOrientation(cell)\n            \n            # Contact inhibition: reduce motility if many neighbors\n            if len(self.getCellNeighbors(cell)) > 4:\n                cell.lambdaChemotaxis = max(100, cell.lambdaChemotaxis - 200)\n            else:\n                # Reset to original value based on type\n                if cell.type == self.cell_type_neuro:\n                    cell.lambdaChemotaxis = 500\n                else:\n                    cell.lambdaChemotaxis = 1000\n\n# Registration of the steppable\nCompuCellSetup.register_steppable(steppable=SimulationSteppable(frequency=1))\n\nWait, but in the start method, how are cells initialized? The code as written loops through self.cell_list during start, but initially, there may be no cells. So perhaps the start method is meant to set the default parameters for cell types, not existing cells. Alternatively, maybe in the start method, the user adds initial cells, but the question doesn't specify. The user's ontology mentions cell types, but the code needs to have basic parameters.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the start method sets the attributes for the cell types, not individual cells. Wait, in CompuCell3D, cell types are managed via the CellType plugin. So in the start method, you can set the parameters for each cell type, but individual cells may need their attributes set when they are created.\n\nBut the code provided in the answer may need to loop through all existing cells (if any) in start, but if it's a new simulation, maybe there are no cells. Hmm, perhaps the start method here is just defining the cell types and their properties. But the example code I've seen often uses the start method to initialize cells. However, the user's problem states \"basic cell types and parameters based on ontology\", so maybe the code defines the cell types and their default parameters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the start method is not the right place to loop through cells. Maybe the cell initialization is handled elsewhere, and the parameters are set in the XML.\n\nBut the user wants the Python code. Let me adjust. The code should define the cell types and their properties. For example, using self.addCellType(\"Neuroblastoma\") and then setting the parameters for each cell type via the simulator or via the dictionary.\n\nWait, perhaps in the start method, we can access the cell type definitions and set parameters. For example:\n\nneuro_type = self.getCellTypeById(\"Neuroblastoma\")\nneuro_type.setVolume(25, 25, 25)  # target volume, etc.\n\nBut I'm not exactly sure of the CompuCell3D API here. Alternatively, in the XML configuration, you set the target volume and lambda volume. But since the user wants the Python code, maybe in the start method, they can iterate over the cell types and set their parameters.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code uses the simulator object to set parameters. But I'm not entirely certain. Let me think again.\n\nIn CompuCell3D, cell properties like targetVolume and lambdaVolume are usually handled by the Volume plugin. These can be set per cell or globally. If the code is in Python, in the start method, you might need to loop through all cells and set their targetVolume and lambdaVolume. But if the simulation starts with cells, perhaps they are initialized elsewhere (e.g., via PIF files).\n\nBut since the user hasn't specified initial cell setup, maybe the code doesn't need to handle that. Instead, the code should define the cell types and their parameters. So perhaps in the start method, the code adds the cell types and sets up the plugins.\n\nWait, the code example provided by the user should include the necessary parts. Let me check a sample CompuCell3D Python script.\n\nA typical script would have:\n\nfrom PySteppables import *\nimport CompuCellSetup\n\nclass SimulationSteppable(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, simulator, _frequency=1):\n        SteppableBasePy.__init__(self, simulator, _frequency)\n        # Initialization code here\n\n    def start(self):\n        # Code to run at the beginning of the simulation\n        pass\n\n    def step(self, mcs):\n        # Code to",
