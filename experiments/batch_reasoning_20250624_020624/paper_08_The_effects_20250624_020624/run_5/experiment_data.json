        "description": "There are numerous biological examples where genes associated with migratory ability of cells also confer the cells with an increased fitness even though these genes may not have any known effect on the cell mitosis rates. Here, we provide insight into these observations by analyzing the effects of cell migration, compression, and contact inhibition on the growth of tumor cell clusters using the Cellular Potts Model (CPM) in a monolayer geometry. This is a follow-up of a previous study (Thalhauser et al. 2010) in which a Moran-type model was used to study the interaction of cell proliferation, migratory potential and death on the emergence of invasive phenotypes. Here, we extend the study to include the effects of cell size and shape. In particular, we investigate the interplay between cell motility and compressibility within the CPM and find that the CPM predicts that increased cell motility leads to smaller cells. This is an artifact in the CPM. An analysis of the CPM reveals an explicit inverse-relationship between the cell stiffness and motility parameters. We use this relationship to compensate for motility-induced changes in cell size in the CPM so that in the corrected CPM, cell size is independent of the cell motility. We find that subject to comparable levels of compression, clusters of motile cells grow faster than clusters of less motile cells, in qualitative agreement with biological observations and our previous study. Increasing compression tends to reduce growth rates. Contact inhibition penalizes clumped cells by halting their growth and gives motile cells an even greater advantage. Finally, our model predicts cell size distributions that are consistent with those observed in clusters of neuroblastoma cells cultured in low and high density conditions."

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this ontology annotation task. First, I need to parse the original description and identify relevant terms for each ontology category: CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH. \n\nStarting with CellOntology. The text mentions tumor cell clusters, neuroblastoma cells. Neuroblastoma is a type of cancer that arises from nerve cells, so looking up Cell Ontology, neuroblastoma cells would be CL:0002495. Also, epithelial and mesenchymal cells are common in migration studies, but the original text doesn't explicitly mention them. However, the study talks about migratory ability, which is often associated with mesenchymal cells. Wait, the example given uses \"Epithelial\" but the user might have specific terms. Let me check. The original description mentions migratory cells, but doesn't specify epithelial or mesenchymal. Maybe I should avoid assuming unless the term is explicitly stated. However, the clarification mentions \"neuroblastoma cells\", so CL:0002495 is a safe bet. Are there other cell types mentioned? Tumor cells in clusters, but \"tumor cell\" is too general. Maybe \"malignant cell\" which is CL:0002593. Let me confirm. CL:0002593 is indeed a malignant cell. So adding both neuroblastoma and malignant cells.\n\nNext, GeneOntology. The study involves cell migration (GO:0016477), cell motility (same as migration?), cell proliferation (GO:0008283), contact inhibition (GO:0060242 is contact inhibition of cell proliferation), and cell division (but the text says genes may not affect mitosis rates, so maybe not division). Also, cell growth (GO:0040007). The model looks at cell size and shape, so cell size regulation (GO:0008361) and cell shape (GO:0008360). The CPM's artifact relates to cell stiffness, which is part of cell mechanics, maybe GO:0072064 (regulation of cell morphogenesis involved in differentiation)? Hmm. Alternatively, cell motility (GO:0016477), cell compressibility might relate to cell volume maintenance (GO:0030007). Let me check the exact terms. Contact inhibition of cell proliferation is GO:0060242. Cell migration is GO:0016477. Cell proliferation is GO:0008283. Cell growth is GO:0040007. Cell size regulation is GO:0008361. Cell shape is GO:0008360. Cell motility is same as migration, so maybe just use migration. Also, cell death is mentioned, but the original study extends to include cell size and shape. So GO terms: Cell migration, cell proliferation, contact inhibition, cell growth, cell size regulation, cell shape.\n\nFor MeSH terms, the topics include cell movement (MeSH D002465), cell proliferation (D011694), contact inhibition (D018301), cellular senescence (D016171) might not be it. The study uses Cellular Potts Model, which is a computational model, so MeSH D049288 (Models, Biological). Also, neuroblastoma (D009447). Cell motility (same as cell movement). Cell compression might relate to stress, physical phenomena, but MeSH terms for compression? Maybe \"Cell Physiological Phenomena\" D002468. Alternatively, \"Stress, Mechanical\" D058109. The model is about tumor growth, so \"Neoplasms\" D009369. Let's check: MeSH terms for cell movement (D002465), cell proliferation (D011694), contact inhibition (D018301), Models, Biological (D049288), Neoplasms (D009447), Neuroblastoma (D009447). Wait, neuroblastoma is D009447. Also, cell size might be \"Cell Size\" D002465? No, D002465 is cell movement. Cell Size is D002467. Let me verify: MeSH term for Cell Size is D002467. So including Cell Size (D002467). Compression might not have a direct term; perhaps \"Mechanical Phenomena\" D058107, but not sure. The study mentions compression effects on growth, so maybe \"Stress, Mechanical\" D058109. Also, \"Cell Compartmentalization\" but that's different. So MeSH terms: Cell Movement, Cell Proliferation, Contact Inhibition, Models-Biological, Neuroblastoma, Cell Size, Stress-Mechanical.\n\nNow, need to structure all this into the JSON format with exact IDs and terms. Double-checking each term's ID and name against the respective ontologies to ensure accuracy. For example, CellOntology's malignant cell is CL:0002593, and neuroblastoma cell is CL:0002495. GeneOntology terms: Cell migration (GO:0016477), Cell proliferation (GO:0008283), Contact inhibition of cell proliferation (GO:0060242), Cell growth (GO:0040007), Cell size regulation (GO:0008361), Cell shape (GO:0008360). MeSH terms: Cell Movement (D002465), Cell Proliferation (D011694), Contact Inhibition (D018301), Models, Biological (D049288), Neuroblastoma (D009447), Cell Size (D002467), Stress, Mechanical (D058109).\n\nEnsuring no extra spaces in term names and IDs. For example, \"Contact inhibition\" in MeSH is \"Contact Inhibition\" as per MeSH. Wait, MeSH term for contact inhibition is \"Contact Inhibition\" (D018301). The GeneOntology term is \"contact inhibition of cell proliferation\" (GO:0060242). Correct.\n\nFinally, compiling the JSON without any explanations, exactly as specified.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0002495\",\n            \"term\": \"Neuroblastoma\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0002593\",\n            \"term\": \"Malignant Cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0016477\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Migration\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0008283\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Proliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0060242\",\n            \"term\": \"Contact Inhibition\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0040007\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Growth\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0008361\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Size Regulation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0008360\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Shape\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002465\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Movement\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D011694\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Proliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D018301\",\n            \"term\": \"Contact Inhibition\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D049288\",\n            \"term\": \"Models, Biological\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D009447\",\n            \"term\": \"Neuroblastoma\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002467\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Size\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D058109\",\n            \"term\": \"Stress, Mechanical\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"

So I'll define these as cell types in the CompuCell3D setup.\n\nNext, the Gene Ontology terms include processes like cell growth, proliferation, shape, size regulation, migration, and contact inhibition. MeSH terms add concepts like mechanical stress, cell movement, proliferation, contact inhibition, and models. These biological processes need to be translated into simulation parameters.\n\nIn CompuCell3D, cell behaviors are often controlled by plugins. For cell growth and size, I can use the Volume plugin to regulate cell volume and target volume. Contact inhibition relates to how cells interact when they touch, which can be handled by the Contact plugin, setting different contact energies between cell types. Cell migration might involve the Chemotaxis plugin, but since the user didn't specify chemicals, maybe just random motion using the RandomMovement plugin. Alternatively, adjusting adhesion parameters could influence movement.\n\nThe simulation class needs to inherit from SteppableBasePy. The __init__ method should call the parent constructor. In the start method, I'll initialize cell types and set up the initial cells. The step method can handle cell proliferation based on a condition, like every 100 steps.\n\nFor basic parameters, each cell type should have volume, target volume, and lambda values for volume and surface constraints. Malignant cells might have higher proliferation rates or different contact energies to simulate aggressive behavior. Contact inhibition can be modeled by having higher energy penalties when cells of the same type come into contact, discouraging overcrowding.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll import necessary modules, define the simulation class with the required methods, set up the cell types, and configure the plugins.
