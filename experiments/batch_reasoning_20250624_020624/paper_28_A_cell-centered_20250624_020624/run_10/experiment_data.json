      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me tackle this query. The user wants structured ontology annotations based on the provided description about embryonic development and cell-centered approaches. They specified CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH categories with exact IDs and terms.\n\nFirst, I'll look for Cell Ontology terms. The text mentions cells as fundamental modules, their biophysical properties, and responses to signals. Relevant terms might be \"Somatic Cell\" (CL:0000003) and \"Epithelial Cell\" (CL:0000066), but the text uses \"cell\" generally. Wait, the example uses \"Epithelial\" as a term, but Cell Ontology terms usually include \"cell\" in the name. Maybe \"Epithelial Cell\" is correct. However, the example shows \"Epithelial\" without \"Cell\". Hmm, but the example might be simplified. I need to check actual CL terms. Let me verify. CL:0000066 is \"epithelial cell\". So, the correct term should be \"epithelial cell\". But the example uses \"Epithelial\" which might not be exact. The user's instruction says term names must be exact. So I should use \"epithelial cell\" for CL:0000066. Similarly, \"somatic cell\" is CL:0002371. Wait, the example had \"Epithelial\" with CL:0000000 as a placeholder. But real terms have specific IDs. The text discusses cells in development, so perhaps \"somatic cell\" (CL:0002371) and \"epithelial cell\" (CL:0000066) are appropriate.\n\nNext, Gene Ontology. The text mentions genetic regulation, cell division, morphogenesis. Terms like \"cell morphogenesis\" (GO:0000902), \"cell-cell signaling\" (GO:0007267), \"response to extracellular stimulus\" (GO:0009991). Also, \"multicellular organism development\" (GO:0007275) might be relevant.\n\nFor MeSH, terms related to developmental biology, biophysics, cell proliferation, and extracellular matrix. MeSH terms like \"Developmental Biology\" (D002869), \"Biophysics\" (D001706), \"Extracellular Matrix\" (D005109), and \"Cell Proliferation\" (D002460) are likely candidates.\n\nI need to ensure IDs are correctly formatted without spaces. For example, MeSH D002869, not D 002869. Also, term names must match exactly. So \"Developmental Biology\" is a MeSH term, \"Cell Proliferation\" as well. Gene Ontology terms should be exact like \"cell morphogenesis\" (lowercase?), wait GO terms are usually capitalized. Let me check. GO uses terms like \"Cell morphogenesis\" (GO:0000902). So the term should be \"cell morphogenesis\" with lowercase? Wait, no, GO terms are in sentence case. For example, \"cell morphogenesis\" is correct. Wait, actually, checking the GO database, \"cell morphogenesis\" (GO:0000902) is the term. But sometimes they are in title case. Wait, the exact term is \"cell morphogenesis\" as per GO. So I need to use the exact term as per the ontology. Let me confirm. For example, \"cell-cell signaling\" is GO:0007267. Yes, that's the exact term. Similarly, \"response to extracellular stimulus\" (GO:0009991). \n\nPutting it all together:\n\nCellOntology: \n- \"somatic cell\" (CL:0002371)\n- \"epithelial cell\" (CL:0000066)\n\nGeneOntology:\n- \"cell morphogenesis\" (GO:0000902)\n- \"cell-cell signaling\" (GO:0007267)\n- \"response to extracellular stimulus\" (GO:0009991)\n- \"multicellular organism development\" (GO:0007275)\n\nMeSH:\n- \"Developmental Biology\" (D002869)\n- \"Biophysics\" (D001706)\n- \"Extracellular Matrix\" (D005109)\n- \"Cell Proliferation\" (D002460)\n\nI need to make sure the JSON structure has these entries under the correct categories with exact IDs and terms. Also, no extra spaces or formatting issues. Let me double-check each ID and term against the respective ontologies to ensure accuracy.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0002371\",\n            \"term\": \"somatic cell\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000066\",\n            \"term\": \"epithelial cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0000902\",\n            \"term\": \"cell morphogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007267\",\n            \"term\": \"cell-cell signaling\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0009991\",\n            \"term\": \"response to extracellular stimulus\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007275\",\n            \"term\": \"multicellular organism development\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002869\",\n            \"term\": \"Developmental Biology\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D001706\",\n            \"term\": \"Biophysics\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D005109\",\n            \"term\": \"Extracellular Matrix\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002460\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Proliferation\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"

Then, the simulation class that inherits from SteppableBasePy. The class should have __init__, start, and step methods.\n\nThe ontology annotations include two cell types: somatic and epithelial cells. So I'll define these in the start method using self.cellType. The cell types need to be created with appropriate parameters. Maybe assign different properties like adhesion or volume for each type.\n\nLooking at the GeneOntology terms: cell morphogenesis, cell-cell signaling, response to extracellular stimulus, and multicellular organism development. These suggest including chemotaxis, secretion of diffusible factors, and cell growth. So I might add a chemical field for signaling, and in the step method, apply chemotaxis towards it. Also, set up secretion and maybe some growth parameters.\n\nThe MeSH terms mention Extracellular Matrix, Developmental Biology, Cell Proliferation, Biophysics. So the ECM could be modeled with a contact energy matrix between cell types. Cell proliferation might involve division based on volume. For biophysics, set up elasticity and volume constraints.\n\nIn the start method, initialize the cell types and set up the contact energy matrix between them and the medium. Also, create a chemical field for cell-cell signaling. For each cell, assign type-specific attributes like target volume and chemotaxis parameters.\n\nIn the step method, handle cell proliferation by checking volume and dividing if necessary. Apply chemotaxis towards the chemical field. Maybe adjust secretion rates here if needed.\n\nWait, should the chemical field be part of the simulation setup? Yes, using self.create_field. Then, in the step method, maybe cells secrete the chemical, creating gradients for others to follow. But to keep it basic, perhaps just set up the field and apply chemotaxis. Also, ensure that the cells respond to extracellular stimulus (the chemical) by moving along the gradient.\n\nAlso, the biophysics parameters like lambda_volume and target_volume should be set for each cell type. The contact energies between different cell types and medium are important for adhesion, affecting how cells interact with the ECM and each other.\n\nLet me outline the code step by step:\n\n1. Imports: CompuCellSetup, steppables, cc3d.CompuCell.\n\n2. Simulation class inheriting from SteppableBasePy.\n\n3. In __init__, call the parent constructor.\n\n4. In start:\n   - Define cell types: somatic, epithelial, and medium.\n   - Set up the contact energy matrix.\n   - Create a chemical field (e.g., 'Signal').\n   - Initialize cells with their types and set target volume, chemotaxis parameters, etc.\n\n5. In step:\n   - Check cell volume and divide if over a threshold (proliferation).\n   - Apply chemotaxis each step.\n\nWait, but how to initialize cells? Since the user didn't specify initial layout, maybe just set up the cell types and parameters, but not create actual cells. Or perhaps create a few cells for demonstration. However, in most CompuCell3D examples, the initial cells are created in a separate steppable or using the XML configuration. Since the user didn't mention, maybe just focus on the setup without initializing specific cells. Alternatively, use a blob of cells.\n\nBut the code needs to be valid. Let me check a minimal example. The start method can set up the cell types and parameters. The step method can handle cell division and chemotaxis.\n\nFor the contact energy matrix, use self.get_xml_element('Contact'). Then set contact energies between each cell type and medium. For example, somatic-medium, epithelial-medium, and somatic-epithelial.\n\nThe chemical field is created using self.create_field.
