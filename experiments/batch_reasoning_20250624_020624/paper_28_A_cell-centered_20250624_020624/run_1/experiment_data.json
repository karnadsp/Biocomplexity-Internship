As more physicists move into developmental biology, we need to be aware of the \u2018\u2018cultural\u2019\u2019 differences between the two fields, whose concepts of \u2018\u2018explanations\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018models\u2019\u2019 traditionally differ: biologists aiming to identify genetic pathways and expression patterns, physicists tending to look for generic underlying principles. Here we discuss how we can combine such biological and physical approaches into a cell-centered approach to developmental biology. Genetic information can only indirectly influence the morphology and physiology of multicellular organisms. DNA translates into proteins and regulatory RNA sequences, which steer the biophysical properties of cells, their response to signals from neighboring cells, and the production and properties of extracellular matrix (ECM).We argue that in many aspects of biological development, cells\u2019 inner workings are irrelevant: what matter are the cell\u2019s biophysical properties, the signals it emits and its responses to extracellular signals. Thus we can separate questions about genetic regulation from questions about development. First, we ask what effects a gene network has on cell phenomenology, and how it operates. We then ask through which mechanisms such single-cell phenomenology directs multicellular morphogenesis and physiology. This approach treats the cell as the fundamental module of development. We discuss how this cell-centered approach\u2014which requires significant input from computational biophysics\u2014can assist and supplement experimental research in developmental biology. We review cell-centered approaches, focusing in particular on the Cellular Potts Model (CPM), and present the Tissue Simulation Toolkit which implements the CPM."

      "response": "<think>\nAlright, let me start by analyzing the original description to identify relevant terms for each ontology category. The text discusses embryonic development, genetic regulation, biophysical properties of cells, cell-cell interactions, and computational models like the Cellular Potts Model (CPM). \n\nFirst, for Cell Ontology (CellOntology), the key terms are cells in general and possibly specific cell types mentioned. However, the text doesn't specify particular cell types like epithelial or mesenchymal directly. But since the approach is cell-centered, maybe \"Cell\" as a general term. Checking Cell Ontology, there's a term \"Cell\" with ID CL:0000000.\n\nNext, Gene Ontology (GeneOntology). The processes mentioned include cell signaling, response to signals, morphogenesis, and cell proliferation. Terms like \"cell-cell signaling\" (GO:0007267), \"response to extracellular stimulus\" (GO:0009991), \"multicellular organism development\" (GO:0007275), and \"cell morphogenesis\" (GO:0000902) fit here.\n\nFor MeSH terms, topics include developmental biology, extracellular matrix, biophysics, and computational models. MeSH terms would be \"Developmental Biology\" (D002454), \"Extracellular Matrix\" (D005109), \"Biophysics\" (D001704), and \"Models, Biological\" (D008957). The Cellular Potts Model is a type of biological model, so \"Models, Biological\" is appropriate.\n\nI need to ensure all IDs are correctly formatted without spaces and terms are exact. Double-checking each term's existence in their respective ontologies is crucial. For example, \"cell-cell signaling\" is indeed GO:0007267. \"Multicellular organism development\" is GO:0007275. MeSH terms like \"Developmental Biology\" have ID D002454. \n\nI'll structure the JSON with the three categories, each containing the relevant terms and IDs. Make sure not to include any extra terms or incorrect IDs. No explanations, just the JSON object as specified.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000000\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007267\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell-cell signaling\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0009991\",\n            \"term\": \"Response to extracellular stimulus\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007275\",\n            \"term\": \"Multicellular organism development\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0000902\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell morphogenesis\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002454\",\n            \"term\": \"Developmental Biology\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D005109\",\n            \"term\": \"Extracellular Matrix\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D001704\",\n            \"term\": \"Biophysics\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D008957\",\n            \"term\": \"Models, Biological\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"
