As more physicists move into developmental biology, we need to be aware of the \u2018\u2018cultural\u2019\u2019 differences between the two fields, whose concepts of \u2018\u2018explanations\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018models\u2019\u2019 traditionally differ: biologists aiming to identify genetic pathways and expression patterns, physicists tending to look for generic underlying principles. Here we discuss how we can combine such biological and physical approaches into a cell-centered approach to developmental biology. Genetic information can only indirectly influence the morphology and physiology of multicellular organisms. DNA translates into proteins and regulatory RNA sequences, which steer the biophysical properties of cells, their response to signals from neighboring cells, and the production and properties of extracellular matrix (ECM).We argue that in many aspects of biological development, cells\u2019 inner workings are irrelevant: what matter are the cell\u2019s biophysical properties, the signals it emits and its responses to extracellular signals. Thus we can separate questions about genetic regulation from questions about development. First, we ask what effects a gene network has on cell phenomenology, and how it operates. We then ask through which mechanisms such single-cell phenomenology directs multicellular morphogenesis and physiology. This approach treats the cell as the fundamental module of development. We discuss how this cell-centered approach\u2014which requires significant input from computational biophysics\u2014can assist and supplement experimental research in developmental biology.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants ontology annotations based on the provided text. They specified CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH terms. The format has to be exact, so I need to be careful with the category names and IDs.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the original description. The main topics are embryonic development, genetic regulation, biophysical properties, cell interactions, extracellular matrix (ECM), Cellular Potts Model (CPM), and computational biophysics. \n\nFor CellOntology, the text mentions cells as fundamental modules. Terms like \"Epithelial\" or \"Mesenchymal\" might be relevant, but the text doesn't specify particular cell types. Maybe general terms like \"Cell\" from CL? Wait, CL has a term for \"cell\" as CL:0000000, but I need to check if that's accurate. Alternatively, maybe \"Somatic Cell\" (CL:0002371) if they are referring to body cells. Hmm, but the text is more about cells in development. Maybe \"Stem Cell\" (CL:0000034) but the text doesn't explicitly mention stem cells. Maybe \"Cell\" (CL:0000000) is the safest bet here since it's a general term.\n\nGeneOntology terms: The text talks about cell communication (GO:0007154), response to signals (GO:0023052), extracellular matrix organization (GO:0030198), cell adhesion (GO:0007155), and morphogenesis (GO:0009653). These seem to fit. Need to confirm the IDs. For example, GO:0007155 is cell adhesion. Yes. ECM organization is GO:0030198. Morphogenesis is GO:0009653. Response to chemical would be GO:0042221, but the text mentions response to signals, so maybe GO:0023052 (signaling). \n\nMeSH terms: The article discusses developmental biology (MeSH D002869), models like Cellular Potts Model, which falls under computational biology (MeSH D018698). Also, biophysics (MeSH D001706) and extracellular matrix (MeSH D005109). Morphogenesis is MeSH D009024. Cell adhesion is MeSH D002448. Those seem appropriate. \n\nI need to ensure that the terms are exactly as per the ontologies. For example, \"Cell Communication\" is the correct term in GO, not \"Cell Signalling\". Similarly, \"Extracellular Matrix Organization\" vs. \"Organization\". Check the exact term names. \n\nWait, GO:0007154 is \"cell communication\", correct. GO:0030198 is \"extracellular matrix organization\". GO:0007155 is \"cell adhesion\". GO:0009653 is \"anatomical structure morphogenesis\". \n\nFor MeSH, \"Developmental Biology\" is D002869, \"Computational Biology\" is D018698, \"Biophysics\" is D001706, \"Extracellular Matrix\" is D005109, \"Morphogenesis\" is D009024, and \"Cell Adhesion\" is D002448. \n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nCellOntology might have \"Cell\" as CL:0000000. \n\nGeneOntology includes terms related to communication, ECM, adhesion, morphogenesis, and response to signals. \n\nMeSH covers developmental biology, computational biology, biophysics, ECM, morphogenesis, and cell adhesion.\n\nI need to structure the JSON exactly as specified, with the right categories and exact IDs and terms. No extra spaces or formatting errors. Let me double-check each term and ID to make sure they're correct.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000000\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007154\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Communication\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0030198\",\n            \"term\": \"Extracellular Matrix Organization\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007155\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0009653\",\n            \"term\": \"Anatomical Structure Morphogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0023052\",\n            \"term\": \"Signaling\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002869\",\n            \"term\": \"Developmental Biology\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D018698\",\n            \"term\": \"Computational Biology\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D001706\",\n            \"term\": \"Biophysics\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D005109\",\n            \"term\": \"Extracellular Matrix\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D009024\",\n            \"term\": \"Morphogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002448\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Adhesion\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"
