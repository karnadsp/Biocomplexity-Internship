Here we discuss how we can combine such biological and physical approaches into a cell-centered approach to developmental biology. Genetic information can only indirectly influence the morphology and physiology of multicellular organisms. DNA translates into proteins and regulatory RNA sequences, which steer the biophysical properties of cells, their response to signals from neighboring cells, and the production and properties of extracellular matrix (ECM).We argue that in many aspects of biological development, cells\u2019 inner workings are irrelevant: what matter are the cell\u2019s biophysical properties, the signals it emits and its responses to extracellular signals. Thus we can separate questions about genetic regulation from questions about development. First, we ask what effects a gene network has on cell phenomenology, and how it operates. We then ask through which mechanisms such single-cell phenomenology directs multicellular morphogenesis and physiology. This approach treats the cell as the fundamental module of development. We discuss how this cell-centered approach\u2014which requires significant input from computational biophysics\u2014can assist and supplement experimental research in developmental biology.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by parsing the user's query. They want structured ontology annotations based on the provided information about a cell-centered approach in developmental biology. The ontologies needed are CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH, each with specific formatting rules.\n\nFirst, I'll look for terms related to cells. The text mentions \"cell-centered approach,\" \"biophysical properties of cells,\" and \"extracellular matrix (ECM).\" For CellOntology, \"Epithelial\" and \"Mesenchymal\" cells are common in development, but the text doesn't explicitly mention them. However, the focus is on cells as fundamental modules, so maybe general terms like \"Cell\" (CL:0000000) would be appropriate here. Wait, checking the Cell Ontology, there's a term \"Cell\" with ID CL:0000000. That seems safe to include.\n\nNext, GeneOntology. The text talks about \"genetic regulation,\" \"proteins and regulatory RNA,\" \"cell division,\" and \"cell signaling.\" Looking for relevant GO terms. \"Cell Division\" is GO:0008283. \"Cell Signaling\" could be GO:0023052. Also, \"Extracellular Matrix Organization\" (GO:0030198) is mentioned because of ECM. \"Multicellular Organism Development\" (GO:0007275) is another relevant term here.\n\nFor MeSH, terms related to developmental biology, biophysics, and computational models. The article discusses \"Developmental Biology\" (D002869), \"Biophysics\" (D001706), \"Models, Biological\" (D008954), and \"Extracellular Matrix\" (D005109). \"Cellular Potts Model\" isn't a MeSH term, so maybe not included. \"Cell Proliferation\" (D002465) is mentioned indirectly through mechanisms directing morphogenesis.\n\nI need to ensure IDs are correctly formatted without spaces. Check each term's existence in their respective ontologies. For example, CellOntology's \"Cell\" is CL:0000000. GO terms: \"Cell Division\" is GO:0008283, \"Cell Signaling\" is GO:0023052, \"Extracellular Matrix Organization\" is GO:0030198, and \"Multicellular Organism Development\" is GO:0007275. MeSH terms: \"Developmental Biology\" is D002869, \"Biophysics\" is D001706, \"Models, Biological\" is D008954, \"Extracellular Matrix\" is D005109, and \"Cell Proliferation\" is D002465.\n\nMake sure term names are exact. Avoid extra spaces or typos. The example provided uses \"Cell Division\" and \"Cell Proliferation,\" so follow that. Finally, structure the JSON correctly, adhering to the categories and formatting requirements. Double-check that all terms fit the context of the original text.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000000\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0008283\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Division\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0023052\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Signaling\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0030198\",\n            \"term\": \"Extracellular Matrix Organization\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007275\",\n            \"term\": \"Multicellular Organism Development\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002869\",\n            \"term\": \"Developmental Biology\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D001706\",\n            \"term\": \"Biophysics\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D008954\",\n            \"term\": \"Models, Biological\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D005109\",\n            \"term\": \"Extracellular Matrix\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002465\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Proliferation\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"

CompuCellSetup and steppables are necessary. I'll import those. Then, the simulation class should inherit from SteppableBasePy. In the __init__ method, I'll make sure to call the parent class's __init__.\n\nNext, the start method. Here, I need to set up the cell types. The ontology includes \"Cell (CL:0000000)\", so maybe define a basic cell type. Also, extracellular matrix organization is mentioned, so perhaps include an ECM type. Using the cell field, I can create cells with specific types. The start method is where I'll initialize the cells. Maybe place some cells randomly and set up the ECM.\n\nFor biophysics, I need to set up the contact energies between cell types. In the start method, I'll access the potts object and set the cell adhesion parameters. The contact energy matrix should have values for Cell-Cell, Cell-ECM, and ECM-ECM interactions. Lower energy for same types to encourage adhesion.\n\nThe step method handles actions each simulation step. The ontology includes cell division and proliferation. So in the step method, I can loop through cells and check if they should divide. Maybe set a target volume and if a cell's volume exceeds it, divide. Also, cell signaling could be simulated by checking neighbors, but maybe that's too complex for a basic example. Instead, focus on division and maybe ECM interaction.\n\nParameters: cell volume, target volume, lambda for volume constraint.
