Here we discuss how we can combine such biological and physical approaches into a cell-centered approach to developmental biology. Genetic information can only indirectly influence the morphology and physiology of multicellular organisms. DNA translates into proteins and regulatory RNA sequences, which steer the biophysical properties of cells, their response to signals from neighboring cells, and the production and properties of extracellular matrix (ECM).We argue that in many aspects of biological development, cells\u2019 inner workings are irrelevant: what matter are the cell\u2019s biophysical properties, the signals it emits and its responses to extracellular signals. Thus we can separate questions about genetic regulation from questions about development. First, we ask what effects a gene network has on cell phenomenology, and how it operates. We then ask through which mechanisms such single-cell phenomenology directs multicellular morphogenesis and physiology. This approach treats the cell as the fundamental module of development. We discuss how this cell-centered approach\u2014which requires significant input from computational biophysics\u2014can assist and supplement experimental research in developmental biology.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to create structured ontology annotations based on the provided description of a cell-centered approach in developmental biology. The output needs to be a JSON object with categories for CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH terms. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the original description to identify relevant concepts. The text discusses cells as fundamental modules, their biophysical properties, genetic regulation, and computational models like the Cellular Potts Model. Key terms include cells, multicellular organisms, developmental biology, biophysics, morphogenesis, cell signaling, and extracellular matrix.\n\nFor CellOntology, the main term here is \"Cell\" itself. The Cell Ontology ID for a generic cell is CL:0000000. That seems appropriate since the text refers to cells as the fundamental units.\n\nMoving to GeneOntology. The text mentions cell-cell signaling, response to extracellular signals, and morphogenesis. Looking up GO terms, \"Cell-Cell Signaling\" is GO:0007267. \"Response to Extracellular Stimulus\" might be GO:0009991. \"Morphogenesis of a Multicellular Organism\" is GO:0009653. These fit the processes described.\n\nFor MeSH terms, the areas covered are developmental biology (MeSH D002869), biophysics (D001706), extracellular matrix (D005109), and cell proliferation (D049630). The text discusses these topics, so including them makes sense.\n\nI need to ensure the JSON structure uses exact category names: CellOntology, GeneOntology, MeSH. The IDs must be correctly formatted without spaces. Also, term names should match exactly. Let me double-check each term and ID against the respective ontologies to confirm accuracy.\n\nYes, CL:0000000 is the correct Cell Ontology ID for cell. The GO IDs check out. MeSH terms are correct as well. Now, arrange them into the specified JSON format without any extra explanations. Make sure there are no typos or formatting errors. That should cover it.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000000\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007267\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell-Cell Signaling\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0009991\",\n            \"term\": \"Response to Extracellular Stimulus\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0009653\",\n            \"term\": \"Morphogenesis of a Multicellular Organism\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002869\",\n            \"term\": \"Developmental Biology\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D001706\",\n            \"term\": \"Biophysics\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D005109\",\n            \"term\": \"Extracellular Matrix\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D049630\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Proliferation\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"

Let me start by recalling the structure of a typical CompuCell3D script.\n\nFirst, the necessary imports: CompuCellSetup and the steppables module. That's standard. Then, creating a simulation class that inherits from SteppableBasePy. The class needs __init__, start, and step methods.\n\nThe ontology annotations mention Cell types from Cell Ontology (CL:0000000), which is the root term for all cells. So maybe define a basic cell type. The Gene Ontology terms include cell-cell signaling, morphogenesis, response to extracellular stimulus. MeSH terms include cell proliferation, extracellular matrix, developmental biology, biophysics. \n\nIn the simulation parameters, I should include cell adhesion (for cell-cell signaling and ECM), maybe volume parameters for biophysics. For cell proliferation, perhaps adding a growth step. Response to extracellular stimulus could translate to chemotaxis or some external field. Morphogenesis might involve cell sorting or differentiation.\n\nLet me structure the code step by step.\n\nImports: import sys and cc3d.CompuCellSetup as CompuCellSetup. Also, from cc3d import Potts3D, CellTypePlugin, etc. Then the simulation class.\n\nIn the __init__ method, call the parent's __init__. In the start method, set up the cell types, maybe a few initial cells. Use the CellTypePlugin to define cell types. Also, set up contact energies for adhesion. Include extracellular matrix (ECM) as a cell type? Or maybe a separate field.\n\nFor the biophysics, set up volume constraints and maybe chemotaxis. In the step method, handle cell proliferation by checking cell volume and dividing if it's large enough. Also, include some chemotaxis movement towards a chemical gradient.\n\nWait, the ontology mentions extracellular matrix, so maybe add an ECM cell type and set appropriate contact energies. For cell proliferation, in the step method, loop through cells and divide them when their volume exceeds a threshold.\n\nAlso, include a chemical field for chemotaxis (response to extracellular stimulus). So add a secretion and chemotaxis parameter in the biophysics.\n\nPutting it all together, define cell types like CellType and ECMType. Set contact energy between cell and ECM. Use VolumePlugin for volume constraints, and ChemotaxisPlugin for chemotaxis towards a chemical.\n\nIn the start method, initialize some cells and maybe an ECM region. Then in step, handle cell division and possibly update the chemical field.\n\nWait, but how to handle ECM? Maybe as a non-proliferating cell type. Or use a separate field. Alternatively, in CompuCell3D, the ECM can be represented as a non-cell element, but perhaps for simplicity, model it as a cell type that's fixed.\n\nSo the code outline would be:\n\n- Import necessary modules.\n- Create a simulation class with __init__, start, step.\n- In start, configure plugins: CellType, Volume, Chemotaxis, Contact.\n- Define cell types: 'Cell' and 'ECM'.\n- Set contact energies between Cell-Cell, Cell-ECM, etc.\n- Set volume parameters for Cells.\n- Set up a chemical field and chemotaxis parameters.\n- Initialize some cells and ECM cells in the simulation.\n- In step, loop through cells, check volume, and divide if needed.\n\nNow, putting this into code:\n\nImports should include CompuCellSetup, Potts3D, plugins (CellType, Volume, Contact, Chemotaxis), steppables, and maybe PlayerPP.\n\nIn the simulation class's start method, assign cell types, set contact energies, volume params, chemotaxis.\n\nFor the ECM, maybe create a cluster of ECM cells in the center. Then, in step, check each cell's volume and divide if over a threshold. Also, apply chemotaxis towards a chemical gradient.\n\nWait, the chemical field needs to be defined. Maybe add a secretion in the ECM cells. But perhaps that's more complex. Alternatively, create a uniform concentration gradient.\n\nAlternatively, in the Chemotaxis plugin, set a constant gradient.
