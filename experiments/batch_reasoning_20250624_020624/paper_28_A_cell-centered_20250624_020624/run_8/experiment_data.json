As more physicists move into developmental biology, we need to be aware of the \u2018\u2018cultural\u2019\u2019 differences between the two fields, whose concepts of \u2018\u2018explanations\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018models\u2019\u2019 traditionally differ: biologists aiming to identify genetic pathways and expression patterns, physicists tending to look for generic underlying principles. Here we discuss how we can combine such biological and physical approaches into a cell-centered approach to developmental biology. Genetic information can only indirectly influence the morphology and physiology of multicellular organisms. DNA translates into proteins and regulatory RNA sequences, which steer the biophysical properties of cells, their response to signals from neighboring cells, and the production and properties of extracellular matrix (ECM).We argue that in many aspects of biological development, cells\u2019 inner workings are irrelevant: what matter are the cell\u2019s biophysical properties, the signals it emits and its responses to extracellular signals. Thus we can separate questions about genetic regulation from questions about development. First, we ask what effects a gene network has on cell phenomenology, and how it operates. We then ask through which mechanisms such single-cell phenomenology directs multicellular morphogenesis and physiology. This approach treats the cell as the fundamental module of development. We discuss how this cell-centered approach\u2014which requires significant input from computational biophysics\u2014can assist and supplement experimental research in developmental biology. We review cell-centered approaches, focusing in particular on the Cellular Potts Model (CPM), and present the Tissue Simulation Toolkit which implements the CPM."

      "response": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this query. The user wants ontology annotations based on the provided text. The main challenge is identifying the correct terms from Cell Ontology, Gene Ontology, and MeSH.\n\nFirst, the original text discusses cells as the fundamental module of development. So for CellOntology, terms like \"Cell\" (CL:0000000) come to mind. Also, since there's mention of epithelial and mesenchymal transitions, maybe \"Epithelial Cell\" (CL:0000066) and \"Mesenchymal Cell\" (CL:0008019) are relevant.\n\nNext, GeneOntology. The text talks about cell communication (GO:0007154), response to extracellular signals (GO:0009991), and developmental process (GO:0032502). These terms fit the biological processes mentioned.\n\nFor MeSH, the focus is on biophysics (D001690), extracellular matrix (D005109), and morphogenesis (D009024). These are key concepts in the paper's discussion of physical mechanisms in development.\n\nI need to ensure IDs are correctly formatted without spaces, and terms are exact. Let me double-check each ontology database to confirm the IDs and terms match the context. Also, make sure category names are exact as specified. No extra explanations, just the JSON object. Alright, that should cover it.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000000\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000066\",\n            \"term\": \"Epithelial Cell\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0008019\",\n            \"term\": \"Mesenchymal Cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007154\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Communication\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0009991\",\n            \"term\": \"Response to Extracellular Stimulus\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0032502\",\n            \"term\": \"Developmental Process\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D001690\",\n            \"term\": \"Biophysical Phenomena\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D005109\",\n            \"term\": \"Extracellular Matrix\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D009024\",\n            \"term\": \"Morphogenesis\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"
