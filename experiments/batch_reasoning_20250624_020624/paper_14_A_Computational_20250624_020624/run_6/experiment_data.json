Molecular targets in the computational model were mapped to signatures of vascular disruption derived from in vitro chemical profiling using the EPA's ToxCast high-throughput screening (HTS) dataset. Simulating the HTS data with the cell-agent based model of vascular development predicted adverse effects of a reference anti-angiogenic thalidomide analog, 5HPP-33, on in vitro angiogenesis with respect to both concentration-response and morphological consequences.

The processes discussed include vasculogenesis (GO:0001570), angiogenesis (GO:0001525), and extracellular matrix organization (GO:0030198). There's also mention of plasminogen activation, which relates to proteolysis (GO:0006508).

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file based on the given ontology annotations. Let's start by recalling the structure of a typical CompuCell3D script. The user specified that the code must include required imports, a simulation class inheriting from SteppableBasePy, and the __init__, start, and step methods. Also, the cell types and parameters should align with the provided ontologies.\n\nFirst, the imports. CompuCellSetup and steppables are necessary. So I'll import those. Also, since we're dealing with cells and maybe some chemical fields, I might need to import things like CellField or others, but the basic setup usually includes CompuCellSetup and the steppables module.\n\nNext, the simulation class. It should inherit from steppables.SteppableBasePy. The class will have an __init__ method where we call the parent's __init__. The start method is where we initialize cells, maybe set up the initial configuration. The step method runs each simulation step.\n\nLooking at the ontology annotations: CellOntology includes EndothelialCell. So I need to define that cell type. The GeneOntology terms are ExtracellularMatrixOrganization, Angiogenesis, Proteolysis, Vasculogenesis. MeSH terms include Chemokines, Plasminogen, ExtracellularMatrix, VascularEndothelialGrowthFactors. These suggest that the simulation involves processes like cell migration, matrix degradation, growth factors influencing cell behavior.\n\nSo in the simulation, I should set up Endothelial cells with parameters related to adhesion, maybe secretion of chemicals like VEGF (VascularEndothelialGrowthFactors), Plasminogen (which is involved in Proteolysis). The ExtracellularMatrix might be a constraint or a field that cells interact with.\n\nIn the start method, I'll probably create some Endothelial cells. Maybe initialize a cluster. For the step method, perhaps implement some logic for cell movement influenced by chemicals. Also, since Proteolysis is involved, maybe cells secrete enzymes that degrade the extracellular matrix.\n\nI should define the cell types using the self.cellTypeDict. Assign EndothelialCell type with appropriate parameters like volume, adhesion, maybe chemotaxis towards VEGF. Also, set up fields for extracellular matrix components and chemicals like VEGF and Plasminogen.\n\nIn the step method, I can adjust cell behaviors each timestep. For example, cells could secrete VEGF, degrade ECM, or respond chemotactically. The exact parameters for lambda and target concentration in chemotaxis would need to be set, but I can use placeholders with reasonable values.\n\nNeed to make sure that all necessary modules are included. For chemotaxis, I might need to import the ChemotaxisPlugin, but since the user didn't specify plugins, perhaps just setting the parameters in the steppable is enough, assuming the plugins are loaded in the XML. But the code here is Python, so maybe in the start method, I can set up the chemotaxis parameters via the simulator's API.\n\nWait, in CompuCell3D, to enable chemotaxis, you typically configure it through the plugins in the XML configuration. However, the user wants only the Python code here, so perhaps the Python script assumes that the necessary plugins (like Chemotaxis, Volume, Contact) are already loaded. So in the Python code, within the start method, I can access the chemotaxis plugin and set the parameters there.\n\nBut the user's instruction says to return only the Python code without additional text, so maybe I need to include the necessary plugin initializations within the Python script. Wait, no\u2014CompuCell3D typically uses an XML configuration file alongside the Python script. But since the user is asking for the Python code, perhaps the code should include the necessary plugin registrations via the simulator object.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code uses the core CompuCell3D setup where the necessary plugins are already loaded. Hmm, but the problem states to generate the Python code, which usually doesn't handle plugin loading; that's done in XML. However, in newer versions, maybe some of this can be done via Python. But I'm not sure. To keep it simple, perhaps the code focuses on the Steppable and defines cell types and their behaviors, assuming that the XML has loaded the required plugins.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nImports: CompuCellSetup and steppables from the appropriate modules.\n\nSimulation class: Inherits from SteppableBasePy, has __init__, start, step.\n\nIn __init__, call parent's __init__.\n\nIn start: initialize cell types, maybe create some cells. Set up extracellular matrix field, VEGF, Plasminogen fields. Configure cell parameters like adhesion, volume, and chemotaxis.\n\nIn step: during each step, perhaps cells secrete VEGF, degrade ECM, or other behaviors. For example, adjust the concentration of VEGF in the field based on cell presence.\n\nAlso, for MeSH terms like ExtracellularMatrix, perhaps that's a field that cells can interact with, maybe degrade via Proteolysis (GO:0006508), which could involve Plasminogen (D010957). So cells might secrete enzymes that break down the matrix.\n\nBut how to model that in CompuCell3D? Maybe using secretion data in the chemotaxis plugin or a secretion steppable. Alternatively, use a diffusion solver for the ECM and have cells degrade it.\n\nBut since the user wants a basic setup, perhaps the code includes the definition of the fields and initial cell setup without complex dynamics, just the structure.\n\nSo, code outline:\n\nimport CompuCellSetup\nfrom PySteppables import *\n\nclass SimulationSteppable(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, simulator, frequency=1):\n        super().__init__(simulator, frequency)\n        # Initialize any necessary variables\n\n    def start(self):\n        # Define cell types\n        self.cell_type_endothelial = self.cellTypeDict[\"EndothelialCell\"]\n        # Set up fields\n        self.vascular_endothelial_growth_factor = self.createField(\"VascularEndothelialGrowthFactor\", \"ConcentrationField\")\n        self.plasminogen = self.createField(\"Plasminogen\", \"ConcentrationField\")\n        self.extracellular_matrix = self.createField(\"ExtracellularMatrix\", \"ConcentrationField\")\n        # Configure cell parameters\n        cell_volume = 25\n        cell_params = {\n            'VolumeLambda': 5.0,\n            'TargetVolume': cell_volume,\n            'LambdaVolume': 2.0,\n            'SurfaceLambda': 0.2,\n        }\n        self.cell_type_endothelial.setVolume(**cell_params)\n        self.cell_type_endothelial.adhesionMolecule = \"Cadherin\"\n        # Initial cell setup\n        for _ in range(100):\n            cell = self.potts.createCell()\n            cell.type = self.cell_type_endothelial\n            # Place cells in the center or some initial position\n            x, y, z = 50, 50, 0  # example coordinates\n            self.cellField[x][y][z] = cell\n        # Chemotaxis setup (assuming Chemotaxis plugin is active)\n        chemotaxis_plugin = self.getChemotaxisPlugin()\n        chemotaxis_data = {\"Medium\": 1.0, \"VascularEndothelialGrowthFactor\": 0.1}\n        for chemotaxis_field in chemotaxis_data:\n            self.cell_type_endothelial.addChemotaxisData(chemotaxis_plugin, chemotaxis_field, chemotaxis_data[chemotaxis_field])\n\n    def step(self, mcs):\n        # Update fields or cell behaviors each step\n        # For example, secrete VEGF and degrade ECM\n        for cell in self.cellList:\n            if cell.type == self.cell_type_endothelial:\n                x, y, z = cell.xCOM, cell.yCOM, cell.zCOM\n                self.vascular_endothelial_growth_factor[x][y][z] += 0.1  # Secrete VEGF\n                self.extracellular_matrix[x][y][z] -= 0.01  # Degrade ECM\n                self.plasminogen[x][y][z] += 0.05  # Produce Plasminogen\n\nBut wait, creating fields might require using the simulator's register* methods. Also, the createField method may not be directly available. Alternatively, fields are usually defined in the XML, but if we are to do it in Python, perhaps via the Simulator's API.\n\nAlternatively, in CompuCell3D, to add a new chemical field, you can use the addField method in the simulator. But I need to check the correct way.\n\nWait, perhaps in the start method, the code should access the simulator object to create the fields. For example:\n\nself.vascular_endothelial_growth_factor = self.simulator.createConcentrationField('VascularEndothelialGrowthFactor')\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact syntax. Alternatively, using self.addField('VEGF') might be the way.\n\nAlternatively, the code might need to use the CompuCell3D modules. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code should define the cell types and parameters, and set up the initial cells, but the fields are part of the XML configuration. Since the user didn't mention XML, but wants the Python code, perhaps the fields are created in the Python script.\n\nIn CompuCellSetup, there's a way to register steppables and initialize fields. So in the start method, using self.addField('VascularEndothelialGrowthFactor') or something similar.\n\nBut to avoid errors,"

Alternatively, use a diffusion solver for the ECM and have cells degrade it.\n\nBut since the user wants a basic setup, perhaps the code includes the definition of the fields and initial cell setup without complex dynamics, just the structure.\n\nSo, code outline:\n\nimport CompuCellSetup\nfrom PySteppables import *\n\nclass SimulationSteppable(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, simulator, frequency=1):\n        super().__init__(simulator, frequency)\n        # Initialize any necessary variables\n\n    def start(self):\n        # Define cell types\n        self.cell_type_endothelial = self.cellTypeDict[\"EndothelialCell\"]\n        # Set up fields\n        self.vascular_endothelial_growth_factor = self.createField(\"VascularEndothelialGrowthFactor\", \"ConcentrationField\")\n        self.plasminogen = self.createField(\"Plasminogen\", \"ConcentrationField\")\n        self.extracellular_matrix = self.createField(\"ExtracellularMatrix\", \"ConcentrationField\")\n        # Configure cell parameters\n        cell_volume = 25\n        cell_params = {\n            'VolumeLambda': 5.0,\n            'TargetVolume': cell_volume,\n            'LambdaVolume': 2.0,\n            'SurfaceLambda': 0.2,\n        }\n        self.cell_type_endothelial.setVolume(**cell_params)\n        self.cell_type_endothelial.adhesionMolecule = \"Cadherin\"\n        # Initial cell setup\n        for _ in range(100):\n            cell = self.potts.createCell()\n            cell.type = self.cell_type_endothelial\n            # Place cells in the center or some initial position\n            x, y, z = 50, 50, 0  # example coordinates\n            self.cellField[x][y][z] = cell\n        # Chemotaxis setup (assuming Chemotaxis plugin is active)\n        chemotaxis_plugin = self.getChemotaxisPlugin()\n        chemotaxis_data = {\"Medium\": 1.0, \"VascularEndothelialGrowthFactor\": 0.1}\n        for chemotaxis_field in chemotaxis_data:\n            self.cell_type_endothelial.addChemotaxisData(chemotaxis_plugin, chemotaxis_field, chemotaxis_data[chemotaxis_field])\n\n    def step(self, mcs):\n        # Update fields or cell behaviors each step\n        # For example, secrete VEGF and degrade ECM\n        for cell in self.cellList:\n            if cell.type == self.cell_type_endothelial:\n                x, y, z = cell.xCOM, cell.yCOM, cell.zCOM\n                self.vascular_endothelial_growth_factor[x][y][z] += 0.1  # Secrete VEGF\n                self.extracellular_matrix[x][y][z] -= 0.01  # Degrade ECM\n                self.plasminogen[x][y][z] += 0.05  # Produce Plasminogen\n\nBut wait, creating fields might require using the simulator's register* methods. Also, the createField method may not be directly available. Alternatively, fields are usually defined in the XML, but if we are to do it in Python, perhaps via the Simulator's API.\n\nAlternatively, in CompuCell3D, to add a new chemical field, you can use the addField method in the simulator. But I need to check the correct way.\n\nWait, perhaps in the start method, the code should access the simulator object to create the fields. For example:\n\nself.vascular_endothelial_growth_factor = self.simulator.createConcentrationField('VascularEndothelialGrowthFactor')\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact syntax. Alternatively, using self.addField('VEGF') might be the way.\n\nAlternatively, the code might need to use the CompuCell3D modules. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code should define the cell types and parameters, and set up the initial cells, but the fields are part of the XML configuration. Since the user didn't mention XML, but wants the Python code, perhaps the fields are created in the Python script.\n\nIn CompuCellSetup, there's a way to register steppables and initialize fields. So in the start method, using self.addField('VascularEndothelialGrowthFactor') or something similar.\n\nBut to avoid errors,",
