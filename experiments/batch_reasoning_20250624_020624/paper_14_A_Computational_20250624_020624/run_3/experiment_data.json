        "description": "Vascular development is a complex process regulated by dynamic biological networks that vary in topology and state across different tissues and developmental stages. Signals regulating de novo blood vessel formation (vasculogenesis) and remodeling (angiogenesis) come from a variety of biological pathways linked to endothelial cell (EC) behavior, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and the local generation of chemokines and growth factors. Simulating these interactions at a systems level requires sufficient biological detail about the relevant molecular pathways and associated cellular behaviors, and tractable computational models that offset mathematical and biological complexity. Here, we describe a novel multicellular agent-based model of vasculogenesis using the CompuCell3D (http://www.compucell3d.org/) modeling environment supplemented with semi-automatic knowledgebase creation. The model incorporates vascular endothelial growth factor signals, pro- and anti-angiogenic inflammatory chemokine signals, and the plasminogen activating system of enzymes and proteases linked to ECM interactions, to simulate nascent EC organization, growth and remodeling. The model was shown to recapitulate stereotypical capillary plexus formation and structural emergence of non-coded cellular behaviors, such as a heterologous bridging phenomenon linking endothelial tip cells together during formation of polygonal endothelial cords. Molecular targets in the computational model were mapped to signatures of vascular disruption derived from in vitro chemical profiling using the EPA's ToxCast high-throughput screening (HTS) dataset. Simulating the HTS data with the cell-agent based model of vascular development predicted adverse effects of a reference anti-angiogenic thalidomide analog, 5HPP-33, on in vitro angiogenesis with respect to both concentration-response and morphological consequences. These findings support the utility of cell agent-based models for simulating a morphogenetic series of events and for the first time demonstrate the applicability of these models for predictive toxicology."

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants a JSON object with ontology annotations based on the provided description. The categories are CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH. I need to extract relevant terms from the text for each category.\n\nStarting with CellOntology. The text mentions endothelial cells (ECs). The Cell Ontology term for endothelial cell is CL:0000115. So I'll add that.\n\nNext, GeneOntology. The description talks about vasculogenesis (GO:0001578) and angiogenesis (GO:0001525). Also, ECM remodeling is mentioned, which relates to extracellular matrix organization (GO:0030198). Cell proliferation is part of the process, so GO:0008283. Plasminogen activating system involves proteolysis (GO:0006508). \n\nFor MeSH terms, vascular development is covered by D014664. Blood Vessels is D001808. Endothelial cells are D004727. Extracellular Matrix is D005109. Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A is D018862. Chemokines are D018833. Plasminogen is D010957. Angiogenesis Inhibitors might be D017121, since thalidomide analog is mentioned as anti-angiogenic. Toxicity testing is part of D064420.\n\nNeed to ensure all IDs are correctly formatted without spaces. Check each term's exact name. For example, \"Endothelial Cells\" in CellOntology, not \"Endothelial\". Similarly, confirm MeSH terms match the exact names. Make sure there are no typos. Let me verify each ID and term against the respective ontologies.\n\nWait, the example uses \"Epithelial\" with CL:0000000, but in reality, the correct ID for endothelial cells is CL:0000115. Okay. Also, check if \"Vasculogenesis\" and \"Angiogenesis\" are correct GO terms. Yes, GO:0001578 and GO:0001525. \n\nMeSH terms: Vascular Development is D014664, correct. Blood Vessels D001808. Endothelial Cells D004727. Extracellular Matrix D005109. VEGF-A D018862. Chemokines D018833. Plasminogen D010957. Angiogenesis Inhibitors D017121.

I know I need to import CompuCellSetup and the steppables module. So I'll start with those.\n\nNext, the simulation class. It should inherit from steppables.SteppableBasePy. The class will have __init__, start, and step methods. In the __init__, I'll make sure to call the parent class's __init__.\n\nLooking at the ontology annotations, the CellOntology mentions Endothelial Cells. So I need to define that cell type. The GeneOntology includes processes like Angiogenesis, Cell Proliferation, Proteolysis, etc. MeSH terms include VEGF-A, ECM, Plasminogen, Chemokines, etc. These might translate into simulation parameters, but since the user wants basic cell types and parameters, maybe I should focus on defining the endothelial cell type and some related properties.\n\nIn the start method, I should initialize the cell types. Using self.cellTypeFactory, I'll create a cell type for Endothelial. Then set up the volume parameters. Maybe set target volume and lambda volume for adhesion.\n\nFor the step method, since the ontology includes cell proliferation, maybe I should include some logic for cell division. Check if a cell's volume exceeds a threshold and then divide. Also, the ECM organization and proteolysis could involve secretion and degradation, so perhaps add a secretion field and set uptake rates.\n\nI'll need to include a VEGF field since it's part of the MeSH terms. Maybe a Plasminogen field as well. Use the Secretion plugin to handle these. Also, set up diffusion for these fields if necessary, but the user might just need the basic setup.\n\nWait, the user specified to include basic cell types and parameters based on the ontology. So I should make sure that all mentioned terms are somehow represented, even if in a simplified way. For example, extracellular matrix organization could be a secretion field for ECM. Proteolysis might involve a degradation parameter.\n\nIn the simulation setup, I should configure the plugins. Use VolumePlugin, ContactPlugin, SecretionPlugin. Also, add the DiffusionSolver for any chemicals like VEGF and Plasminogen.\n\nPutting it all together: the code will start with imports, then set up the simulation with appropriate plugins and cell types.
