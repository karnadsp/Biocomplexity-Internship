Simulating these interactions at a systems level requires sufficient biological detail about the relevant molecular pathways and associated cellular behaviors, and tractable computational models that offset mathematical and biological complexity. Here, we describe a novel multicellular agent-based model of vasculogenesis using the CompuCell3D (http://www.compucell3d.org/) modeling environment supplemented with semi-automatic knowledgebase creation. The model incorporates vascular endothelial growth factor signals, pro- and anti-angiogenic inflammatory chemokine signals, and the plasminogen activating system of enzymes and proteases linked to ECM interactions, to simulate nascent EC organization, growth and remodeling. The model was shown to recapitulate stereotypical capillary plexus formation and structural emergence of non-coded cellular behaviors, such as a heterologous bridging phenomenon linking endothelial tip cells together during formation of polygonal endothelial cords. Molecular targets in the computational model were mapped to signatures of vascular disruption derived from in vitro chemical profiling using the EPA's ToxCast high-throughput screening (HTS) dataset. Simulating the HTS data with the cell-agent based model of vascular development predicted adverse effects of a reference anti-angiogenic thalidomide analog, 5HPP-33, on in vitro angiogenesis with respect to both concentration-response and morphological consequences.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to parse this query. The user wants structured ontology annotations based on the provided information about vascular development. They need entries for CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH. I need to make sure the categories are named exactly as specified, no typos.\n\nFirst, looking at the original description. It mentions endothelial cells (EC), extracellular matrix (ECM), vasculogenesis, angiogenesis, vascular endothelial growth factor, plasminogen activating system, enzymes, proteases, chemokines, and terms like cell proliferation, morphogenesis, etc. \n\nFor CellOntology, the key cell type here is endothelial cells. The correct CL ID for endothelial cell is CL:0000115. So that should be included.\n\nNext, GeneOntology. The processes mentioned include vasculogenesis (GO:0001570), angiogenesis (GO:0001525), extracellular matrix organization (GO:0030198), cell proliferation (GO:0008283), and maybe cell morphogenesis (GO:0000902) from the part about morphogenetic events. Also, the plasminogen activating system involves proteolysis (GO:0006508). Growth factor activity (GO:0008083) for VEGF signals. \n\nFor MeSH terms, vascular development relates to MeSH D014655 (Vascular Development). Vasculogenesis is D017116. Angiogenesis is D000096. Extracellular Matrix is D005109. Endothelial cells are D004727. Plasminogen is D010957. Protease enzymes would be D011485 (Peptide Hydrolases). Chemokines are D018875. Thalidomide analogs might be under Thalidomide (D013792), but the example uses ToxCast and a thalidomide analog, so maybe D013792. Also, predictive toxicology is D062885.\n\nNeed to check each term and ID for exactness. Make sure no spaces in IDs, correct capitalization for terms. Terms like \"Endothelial\" (CellOntology), \"Vasculogenesis\" (GO), \"Vascular Development\" (MeSH). \n\nDouble-checking each ontology database. For example, CellOntology's endothelial cell is indeed CL:0000115. GO terms: Vasculogenesis GO:0001570, Angiogenesis GO:0001525, etc. MeSH terms: Vascular Development D014655, Angiogenesis D000096, Endothelial Cells D004727, etc.\n\nMake sure all terms are exact without extra spaces. Avoid any typos. Structure the JSON exactly as per the example, with arrays under each category. No additional explanations, just the JSON.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000115\",\n            \"term\": \"Endothelial\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0001570\",\n            \"term\": \"Vasculogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0001525\",\n            \"term\": \"Angiogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0030198\",\n            \"term\": \"ExtracellularMatrixOrganization\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0008283\",\n            \"term\": \"CellProliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0000902\",\n            \"term\": \"CellMorphogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0006508\",\n            \"term\": \"Proteolysis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0008083\",\n            \"term\": \"GrowthFactorActivity\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D014655\",\n            \"term\": \"VascularDevelopment\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D017116\",\n            \"term\": \"Vasculogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D000096\",\n            \"term\": \"Angiogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D005109\",\n            \"term\": \"ExtracellularMatrix\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D004727\",\n            \"term\": \"EndothelialCells\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D010957\",\n            \"term\": \"Plasminogen\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D011485\",\n            \"term\": \"PeptideHydrolases\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D018875\",\n            \"term\": \"Chemokines\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D013792\",\n            \"term\": \"Thalidomide\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D062885\",\n            \"term\": \"PredictiveToxicology\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a CompuCell3D simulation Python file based on the provided ontology annotations. Let me start by recalling the structure of a typical CompuCell3D script.\n\nFirst, the necessary imports: CompuCellSetup and the steppables module. Then, a simulation class that inherits from SteppableBasePy. The class should have __init__, start, and step methods.\n\nLooking at the ontology annotations, the cell type is Endothelial. So I'll define that in the cell_types list. The GeneOntology terms include processes like angiogenesis, extracellular matrix organization, growth factor activity, etc. These might translate into cell behaviors like secretion, proliferation, and chemotaxis.\n\nIn the start method, I should initialize the cell types with their parameters. Maybe set up the extracellular matrix (ECM) and some chemicals. The step method will handle behaviors each simulation step. For example, cells could secrete ECM, respond to growth factors, proliferate, and undergo apoptosis under certain conditions.\n\nAlso, MeSH terms include things like Plasminogen, Chemokines, and Thalidomide. Perhaps these are chemicals in the simulation. I'll need to add a chemical field for VEGF as part of the angiogenesis process.\n\nWait, the user mentioned including basic cell types and parameters. So I should set adhesion, volume, and maybe some lambda parameters for the energy functions. Also, the simulation dimensions need to be set via CompuCellSetup.\n\nLet me structure the code step by step. Imports first, then the simulation class. In __init__, call the parent constructor. In start, initialize cell types, set up fields, and maybe place initial cells. In step, implement behaviors like ECM secretion, checking for proliferation conditions, and adjusting chemical concentrations.\n\nI need to make sure the code is valid. Use the CellTypePlugin to define cell types, maybe a SecretionPlugin for ECM components. The GrowthSteppable can handle cell growth. Also, adding a chemical field for VEGF and having cells secrete it.\n\nWait, the user specified to include the required methods: __init__, start, step. The start method is where I'll set up the initial configuration. The step method runs every simulation step.\n\nLet me check if I'm missing any components. The simulation should have a proper XML setup, but since the user wants a Python file, maybe using the standard setup without an XML. So in the start method, I'll create a cell field and initialize some cells.\n\nAlso, parameters like cell volume, adhesion strength, and target volume should be set. For angiogenesis, maybe cells migrate towards higher VEGF concentrations. I'll include a chemotaxis parameter in the plugin.\n\nPutting it all together: imports, simulation class with the three methods, cell types, ECM setup, growth factors, proliferation conditions, and chemotaxis. Include comments if allowed, but the user said to return only the code without explanations. So omit comments.\n\nDouble-check the syntax. Make sure all modules are imported, methods are properly defined, and plugins are registered. Use self.cell_type_params to set up cell type parameters.
