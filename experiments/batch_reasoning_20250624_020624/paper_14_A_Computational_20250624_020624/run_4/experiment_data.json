        "description": "Vascular development is a complex process regulated by dynamic biological networks that vary in topology and state across different tissues and developmental stages. Signals regulating de novo blood vessel formation (vasculogenesis) and remodeling (angiogenesis) come from a variety of biological pathways linked to endothelial cell (EC) behavior, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and the local generation of chemokines and growth factors. Simulating these interactions at a systems level requires sufficient biological detail about the relevant molecular pathways and associated cellular behaviors, and tractable computational models that offset mathematical and biological complexity. Here, we describe a novel multicellular agent-based model of vasculogenesis using the CompuCell3D (http://www.compucell3d.org/) modeling environment supplemented with semi-automatic knowledgebase creation. The model incorporates vascular endothelial growth factor signals, pro- and anti-angiogenic inflammatory chemokine signals, and the plasminogen activating system of enzymes and proteases linked to ECM interactions, to simulate nascent EC organization, growth and remodeling. The model was shown to recapitulate stereotypical capillary plexus formation and structural emergence of non-coded cellular behaviors, such as a heterologous bridging phenomenon linking endothelial tip cells together during formation of polygonal endothelial cords. Molecular targets in the computational model were mapped to signatures of vascular disruption derived from in vitro chemical profiling using the EPA's ToxCast high-throughput screening (HTS) dataset. Simulating the HTS data with the cell-agent based model of vascular development predicted adverse effects of a reference anti-angiogenic thalidomide analog, 5HPP-33, on in vitro angiogenesis with respect to both concentration-response and morphological consequences. These findings support the utility of cell agent-based models for simulating a morphogenetic series of events and for the first time demonstrate the applicability of these models for predictive toxicology."

      "response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to create a JSON object with ontology annotations based on the provided information. The user specified three categories: CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH. Each category needs exact term names and IDs without spaces. Let me start by parsing the original description to identify relevant terms.\n\nThe text mentions endothelial cells (EC), so I should check Cell Ontology for that. The term \"endothelial cell\" exists in CL as CL:0000115. That's a good candidate for CellOntology.\n\nNext, Gene Ontology. The processes discussed include vasculogenesis, angiogenesis, and cell proliferation. Looking up GO, vasculogenesis is GO:0001570, angiogenesis is GO:0001525, and cell proliferation is GO:0008283. The extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling might correspond to \"extracellular matrix organization\" which is GO:0030198. Also, the plasminogen activating system involves proteases, so \"proteolysis\" is GO:0006508. These should go under GeneOntology.\n\nFor MeSH terms, the topics include vascular development, which maps to \"Neovascularization, Physiologic\" (D018157). Endothelial cells are D004727, extracellular matrix is D005109, and chemokines are D018908. The model uses agent-based modeling, which might be under \"Models, Biological\" as D008954. ToxCast is part of the EPA's high-throughput screening, but MeSH might not have a specific term for ToxCast, so I'll stick to the mentioned biological terms.\n\nI need to ensure all IDs are correctly formatted without spaces and terms are exact. Let me double-check each ID:\n\n- CL:0000115 is indeed endothelial cell.\n- GO terms: 0001570 (vasculogenesis), 0001525 (angiogenesis), 0008283 (cell proliferation), 0030198 (extracellular matrix organization), 0006508 (proteolysis).\n- MeSH: D018157 (Neovascularization, Physiologic), D004727 (Endothelial Cells), D005109 (Extracellular Matrix), D018908 (Chemokines), D008954 (Models, Biological).\n\nEverything seems to check out.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants a CompuCell3D simulation file based on specific ontology annotations. They mentioned endothelial cells and processes like vasculogenesis, angiogenesis, extracellular matrix organization, proteolysis, cell proliferation, and some MeSH terms like Chemokines and Extracellular Matrix. \n\nFirst, I need to start with the necessary imports. CompuCellSetup and steppables are required. Then, create a simulation class that inherits from SteppableBasePy. The class should have __init__, start, and step methods.\n\nIn the __init__ method, I'll call the parent's init. The start method is where I'll set up the cell types and their parameters. The ontology includes endothelial cells, so I'll define that cell type. Also, since there's extracellular matrix (ECM) and chemokines mentioned, maybe add a ECM cell type and a chemical field for chemokines.\n\nFor the cell types, endothelial cells might have properties related to proliferation, adhesion, and maybe secretion of chemokines. The ECM could be a non-proliferative type. I'll set adhesion parameters between them to model interactions.\n\nIn the start method, I'll initialize the simulation with a cell field, maybe a blob of endothelial cells surrounded by ECM. The step method will handle cell behaviors each time step. Since there's cell proliferation, I'll include a check for cell volume and then divide cells if they're large enough. Also, considering proteolysis and ECM organization, maybe adjust the ECM properties over time or have cells degrade the ECM, but that might be more complex. For simplicity, maybe just include a basic secretion of a chemokine field that endothelial cells respond to by chemotaxis.\n\nThe chemical field for chemokines should be added using the addSecretorFieldData. In the step method, endothelial cells could secrete chemokines, and maybe move towards higher concentrations. Also, since there's angiogenesis and vasculogenesis, perhaps some directional growth influenced by the chemokine gradient.\n\nI need to make sure all the parameters are set, like cell adhesion energies, volumes, and secretion/uptake rates. The simulation XML is generated using CompuCellSetup.run, passing the steppable and the simulation name.\n\nWait, did I miss any ontology terms? Vasculogenesis, angiogenesis, ECM organization, proteolysis, cell proliferation. The ECM organization might involve the ECM cell type and interactions. Proteolysis could be modeled by cells degrading ECM, but maybe that's beyond the basic setup. For a basic example, include secretion and chemotaxis to represent some of these processes.\n\nSet the lattice type and dimensions. Maybe 100x100x1 for a 2D simulation. Include the plugins: CellType, Volume, Contact, Chemotaxis, and maybe Secretion. The Contact plugin handles adhesion energies between cell types. Chemotaxis allows cells to move along chemical gradients. Secretion for the chemokine field.\n\nIn the start method, initialize some endothelial cells in the center. The step method handles cell division based on volume. Also, secrete chemokine from endothelial cells and have them chemotax towards higher concentrations. That should cover some aspects of angiogenesis and cell proliferation.\n\nCheck that all required methods are included. The code should have the imports, the simulation class with __init__, start, step, and the necessary setup. Parameters for cell types, adhesion, volumes, chemotaxis, and secretion.
