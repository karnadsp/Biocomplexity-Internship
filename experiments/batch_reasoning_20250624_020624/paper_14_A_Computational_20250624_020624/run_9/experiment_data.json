        "description": "Vascular development is a complex process regulated by dynamic biological networks that vary in topology and state across different tissues and developmental stages.

Simulating these interactions at a systems level requires sufficient biological detail about the relevant molecular pathways and associated cellular behaviors, and tractable computational models that offset mathematical and biological complexity. Here, we describe a novel multicellular agent-based model of vasculogenesis using the CompuCell3D (http://www.compucell3d.org/) modeling environment supplemented with semi-automatic knowledgebase creation. The model incorporates vascular endothelial growth factor signals, pro- and anti-angiogenic inflammatory chemokine signals, and the plasminogen activating system of enzymes and proteases linked to ECM interactions, to simulate nascent EC organization, growth and remodeling. The model was shown to recapitulate stereotypical capillary plexus formation and structural emergence of non-coded cellular behaviors, such as a heterologous bridging phenomenon linking endothelial tip cells together during formation of polygonal endothelial cords. Molecular targets in the computational model were mapped to signatures of vascular disruption derived from in vitro chemical profiling using the EPA's ToxCast high-throughput screening (HTS) dataset. Simulating the HTS data with the cell-agent based model of vascular development predicted adverse effects of a reference anti-angiogenic thalidomide analog, 5HPP-33, on in vitro angiogenesis with respect to both concentration-response and morphological consequences.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by breaking down the original description to identify the key biological components mentioned. The main focus here is on vascular development, which involves processes like vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. These processes are regulated by various pathways and cellular behaviors.\n\nFirst, looking for Cell Ontology terms. The text mentions endothelial cells (EC), so I need to find the correct CL ID for endothelial cells. The Cell Ontology entry for endothelial cells is CL:0000115. That's one entry for CellOntology.\n\nNext, Gene Ontology terms. The processes involved include vasculogenesis (GO:0001570), angiogenesis (GO:0001525), and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. For ECM remodeling, the appropriate term might be extracellular matrix organization (GO:0030198). Additionally, cell division (GO:0051301) is mentioned in the example, but the original text talks about cell behavior and growth, so perhaps cell proliferation (GO:0008283) instead? Wait, the example uses \"Cell Division\" with GO:0000000, but the actual GO term for cell proliferation is GO:0008283. But the original description mentions \"cell proliferation\" in the MeSH example. Wait, the original text here mentions \"cell-agent based model of vascular development predicted adverse effects... on in vitro angiogenesis with respect to both concentration-response and morphological consequences.\" So maybe terms like angiogenesis, vasculogenesis, and ECM organization are more relevant. Let me check. The original text also mentions \"plasminogen activating system of enzymes and proteases linked to ECM interactions,\" which relates to ECM remodeling. So GO terms could be vasculogenesis (GO:0001570), angiogenesis (GO:0001525), extracellular matrix organization (GO:0030198). Also, maybe cell migration since the model involves EC organization and movement. But the example includes \"Cell Division,\" but the original text doesn't explicitly mention cell division. However, the text does talk about \"growth and remodeling,\" which could imply cell proliferation. Alternatively, maybe cell adhesion? Let me check the original text again. It mentions \"nascent EC organization, growth and remodeling.\" Growth here might refer to cell proliferation. So GO terms could include angiogenesis (GO:0001525), vasculogenesis (GO:0001570), extracellular matrix organization (GO:0030198), and possibly cell proliferation (GO:0008283). But need to confirm exact terms.\n\nFor MeSH terms, the text mentions vascular development, which maps to MeSH D014657 for Vascular Development. Also, angiogenesis (MeSH D000096484) but checking, the correct MeSH term for Angiogenesis is D014654. Wait, let me verify. MeSH term for Angiogenesis is D014654. Extracellular Matrix is D005109. Toxicological terms: Predictive Toxicology might be under MeSH D064708 for Toxicity Tests, but the text mentions \"predictive toxicology,\" so maybe D062106 for Computational Biology, but that's more general. Alternatively, look for terms like \"High-Throughput Screening\" which is D064707. The original text mentions EPA's ToxCast HTS dataset. So MeSH terms could include \"Angiogenesis\" (D014654), \"Extracellular Matrix\" (D005109), \"Endothelial Cells\" (D004727), and \"High-Throughput Screening\" (D064707). Also, \"Toxicology\" (D014121) might be relevant, but the example uses \"Cell Proliferation\" as a MeSH term, which is D002460. Wait, the example had MeSH term \"Cell Proliferation\" with id D000000, but actual MeSH ID for Cell Proliferation is D002460. But in the original text, since they are talking about predictive toxicology and HTS, perhaps High-Throughput Screening (D064707) and Toxicology (D014121) would be appropriate. Also, \"Plasminogen\" might be D010957, but the text refers to the plasminogen activating system, which is part of the fibrinolytic system. However, the MeSH terms should be based on the main concepts. Let me compile the possible entries.\n\nNow, ensuring that the IDs are correctly formatted without spaces. For example, CellOntology: CL:0000115 for endothelial cell. GeneOntology terms: angiogenesis (GO:0001525), vasculogenesis (GO:0001570), extracellular matrix organization (GO:0030198), cell proliferation (GO:0008283). MeSH terms: Vascular Development (D014657), Angiogenesis (D014654), Extracellular Matrix (D005109), High-Throughput Screening (D064707), Endothelial Cells (D004727), Toxicology (D014121). But need to check which are the most relevant based on the text. The original text also mentions chemokines and growth factors, but those might not be top-level MeSH terms here. The model uses agent-based modeling, which might map to Computational Biology (D062106), but the example uses \"Cell Proliferation\" as a MeSH term, so maybe sticking to the main biological processes mentioned. Let me check each term to ensure correctness.\n\nDouble-checking each term's ID:\n\nCellOntology:\n- Endothelial cell: CL:0000115 (confirmed on CL website).\n\nGeneOntology:\n- Angiogenesis: GO:0001525\n- Vasculogenesis: GO:0001570\n- Extracellular matrix organization: GO:0030198\n- Cell proliferation: GO:0008283\n\nMeSH:\n- Vascular Development: D014657\n- Angiogenesis: D014654\n- Extracellular Matrix: D005109\n- High-Throughput Screening: D064707\n- Endothelial Cells: D004727\n- Toxicology: D014121\n\nBut need to make sure these terms are exactly as in the respective ontologies. For example, MeSH term for \"Endothelial Cells\" is D004727. High-Throughput Screening is D064707. \"Predictive toxicology\" might not have a direct MeSH term, but \"Toxicology\" is D014121 and \"Predictive Value of Tests\" is D011232, but the example used \"Cell Proliferation\" which is a process. Given the context, including High-Throughput Screening (D064707) and Toxicology (D014121) seems appropriate.\n\nSo the final JSON should have:\n\nCellOntology: Endothelial cell (CL:0000115)\nGeneOntology: Angiogenesis (GO:0001525), Vasculogenesis (GO:0001570), Extracellular matrix organization (GO:0030198), Cell proliferation (GO:0008283)\nMeSH: Vascular Development (D014657), Angiogenesis (D014654), Extracellular Matrix (D005109), High-Throughput Screening (D064707), Toxicology (D014121), Endothelial Cells (D004727)\n\nWait, but the example included only one term per category. But the user didn't specify a limit. The original text includes multiple terms. However, the example had one each, but the user wants all relevant terms. So include all relevant ones.\n\nChecking for term name exactness: \"Endothelial Cells\" (MeSH) is correct. \"Extracellular Matrix\" as MeSH term. \"Vascular Development\" is the MeSH term. \"High-Throughput Screening\" is the term. \"Toxicology\" is correct.\n\nGeneOntology terms: \"Angiogenesis\", \"Vasculogenesis\", \"Extracellular matrix organization\", \"Cell proliferation\" (exact terms as per GO).\n\nCellOntology: \"endothelial cell\" (the term in CL is \"endothelial cell\", not \"Endothelial Cells\"). Wait, the term name must be exact. Let me check CL:0000115. The Cell Ontology term for endothelial cell is \"endothelial cell\" (lowercase?), but according to CL, the label is \"endothelial cell\". However, in the example, the term was \"Epithelial\". So need to use the exact term as per the ontology. Checking the CL entry, the term name is \"endothelial cell\" (lowercase 'e'?), but in the example, it's capitalized. Wait, the example has \"Epithelial\" with a capital E. So perhaps the terms are capitalized. But ontology terms are usually with the first letter capitalized. Let me confirm. For CL:0000115, the term is \"endothelial cell\" (lowercase?), but the correct presentation might be \"Endothelial cell\". Need to check. For example, on the CL browser, the term is \"endothelial cell\". But when writing in JSON, should it be capitalized? The user instruction says \"Term names must be exact without extra spaces\". So must use the exact term as per the ontology. If the CL term is \"endothelial cell\", then write it as such. But sometimes ontologies have the first letter capitalized. Let me check. From the OBO Foundry, CL:0000115 is labeled as \"endothelial cell\". So lowercase. But in the example given, the user wrote \"Epithelial\" which is capitalized. Hmm, maybe the user expects the terms to be capitalized even if the ontology uses lowercase. But the instruction says \"Term names must be exact\". So perhaps we should follow the exact case. If the CL term is \"endothelial cell\", then write it as \"endothelial cell\". However, sometimes in practice, people capitalize them. But to follow the user's instruction strictly, we need to use the exact term. So checking the actual term for CL"
