Here we explored the conditions leading to the emergence of the different morphologies of DCIS using a two-dimensional multi-cell lattice-based model that incorporates cell proliferation, apoptosis, necrosis, adhesion, and contractility.

In contrast, low proliferation and high apoptosis led to the micropapillary morphology, whereas high proliferation and high apoptosis led to the cribriform morphology. The natural progression between morphologies cannot be investigated in vivo since lesions are usually surgically removed upon detection; however, our model suggests probable transitions between these morphologies during breast cancer progression. Importantly, cribriform and comedo appear to be the ultimate morphologies of DCIS. Motivated by previous experimental studies demonstrating that tumor cells behave differently depending on where they are located within the mammary duct in vivo or in engineered tissues, we examined the effects of tissue geometry on the progression of DCIS. In agreement with our previous experimental work, we found that cells are more likely to invade from the end of ducts and that this preferential invasion is regulated by cell adhesion and contractility. This model provides additional insight into tumor cell behavior and allows the exploration of phenotypic transitions not easily monitored in vivo."

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me start by understanding the task. The user wants me to create a JSON object with ontology annotations based on the provided information about ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The annotations need to be categorized into CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH terms with specific formatting requirements.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the original description for relevant terms. The text mentions \"mammary epithelial cells\" which points to a Cell Ontology term. Checking the Cell Ontology, the term \"mammary epithelial cell\" has the ID CL:0002500. So that's a candidate for CellOntology.\n\nNext, for Gene Ontology (GO) terms. The model incorporates processes like cell proliferation, apoptosis, necrosis, adhesion, and contractility. These correspond to GO terms:\n- Cell proliferation: GO:0008283\n- Apoptosis: GO:0006915\n- Cell adhesion: GO:0007155\n- Contractility might be part of muscle cell contraction, but since the context is general cell contractility, perhaps \"cell contraction\" (GO:0006928) is more appropriate. Wait, but the model includes contractility as a factor in cell behavior. Maybe \"actin-mediated cell contraction\" (GO:0032154) is more specific? However, the term mentioned is just \"contractility\", so perhaps the broader term \"cell motility\" (GO:0048870) isn't right. Let me verify. The GO term for contractility itself might not exist directly. Alternatively, \"cellular response to mechanical stimulus\" (GO:0071260) if it's about mechanical properties. Hmm, maybe sticking to the exact terms mentioned: the model includes contractility, but GO might not have a direct term. Alternatively, \"cell morphogenesis\" (GO:0000902) if it's about shape changes. Alternatively, \"cell migration\" (GO:0016477) if contractility relates to movement. The user mentioned \"contractility\" as a parameter, so maybe \"cell contraction\" (GO:0006928) is the best fit here. I need to check. GO:0006928 is \"cell contraction\", which involves the process of a cell becoming smaller in one or more dimensions. That might align with contractility in the model. So include that.\n\nNecrosis is mentioned, which is GO:0070269 (necrotic cell death). So apoptosis and necrosis are both cell death processes. The model includes both, so those GO terms should be included.\n\nFor MeSH terms, the topics are ductal carcinoma in situ (MeSH D054948), breast neoplasms (D001943), cell proliferation (D002466), apoptosis (D017209), necrosis (D009336), cell adhesion (D002448), and contractility. Contractility might be under \"Muscle Contraction\" (D009121), but since it's about general cell contractility, maybe \"Cell Movement\" (D002465) is better. Alternatively, \"Cell Physiological Processes\" (D002468) as a broader term. But MeSH has \"Cell Adhesion\" (D002448) and \"Cell Proliferation\" (D002466) which are exact matches. For contractility, perhaps \"Cell Movement\" (D002465) is the closest. Alternatively, \"Muscle Contraction\" if the model refers to muscle-like contractility, but the context is mammary cells. Maybe \"Cell Movement\" is safer.\n\nThe original description also mentions tissue morphology terms like micropapillary, cribriform, solid, and comedo. Are these MeSH terms? Checking, \"Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating\" is MeSH D054948 (which is DCIS), but the morphologies themselves might not have specific MeSH terms. Alternatively, \"Breast Neoplasms\" (D001943) is relevant. Since the study is about DCIS progression and tumor cell behavior, terms like Neoplasm Invasiveness (D009361) or Neoplasm Metastasis (D009362) might be applicable, but the text specifically mentions invasion from the ends of ducts regulated by adhesion and contractility. So \"Neoplasm Invasiveness\" (D009361) could be a MeSH term here.\n\nPutting this all together:\n\nCellOntology would have mammary epithelial cells (CL:0002500).\n\nGeneOntology includes terms for cell proliferation (GO:0008283), apoptosis (GO:0006915), necrosis (GO:0070269), cell adhesion (GO:0007155), and cell contraction (GO:0006928).\n\nMeSH terms include Ductal carcinoma in situ (D054948), Breast Neoplasms (D001943), Cell Proliferation (D002466), Apoptosis (D017209), Necrosis (D009336), Cell Adhesion (D002448), and Neoplasm Invasiveness (D009361).\n\nI need to ensure all IDs are correctly formatted without spaces and terms are exact. Let me double-check each ID:\n\n- CL:0002500 is correct for mammary epithelial cell.\n- GO terms: 0008283 (proliferation), 0006915 (apoptosis), 0070269 (necrotic cell death), 0007155 (cell adhesion), 0006928 (cell contraction).\n- MeSH: D054948 (DCIS), D001943 (Breast Neoplasms), D002466 (Cell Proliferation), D017209 (Apoptosis), D009336 (Necrosis), D002448 (Cell Adhesion), D009361 (Neoplasm Invasiveness).\n\nAre there any other terms? The model also mentions tissue geometry and invasion. For MeSH, maybe \"Extracellular Matrix\" (D005109) if adhesion is involved, but the user didn't mention that. The text says invasion regulated by adhesion and contractility, so Neoplasm Invasiveness is appropriate.\n\nI think that covers all the relevant terms mentioned. Now, structure the JSON accordingly, ensuring categories are exact and terms are correctly capitalized without extra spaces.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0002500\",\n            \"term\": \"mammary epithelial cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0008283\",\n            \"term\": \"cell proliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0006915\",\n            \"term\": \"apoptotic process\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0070269\",\n            \"term\": \"necrotic cell death\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007155\",\n            \"term\": \"cell adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0006928\",\n            \"term\": \"cell contraction\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D054948\",\n            \"term\": \"Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D001943\",\n            \"term\": \"Breast Neoplasms\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002466\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Proliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D017209\",\n            \"term\": \"Apoptosis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D009336\",\n            \"term\": \"Necrosis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002448\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D009361\",\n            \"term\": \"Neoplasm Invasiveness\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a CompuCell3D simulation Python file based on the provided ontology annotations. Let me start by recalling the structure of a typical CompuCell3D script.\n\nFirst, the necessary imports: CompuCellSetup and various modules from steppables. Then, a simulation class that inherits from SteppableBasePy. The class must have __init__, start, and step methods.\n\nLooking at the ontology annotations, the cell type is mammary epithelial cell. The Gene Ontology terms include apoptosis, adhesion, contraction, necrosis, and proliferation. MeSH terms relate to breast neoplasms, proliferation, adhesion, necrosis, apoptosis, and invasiveness.\n\nSo, the simulation should model these processes. In the start method, I'll set up the cell types. The cell types mentioned are mammary epithelial cells and possibly others like necrotic or apoptotic cells. Maybe define different types for healthy, apoptotic, and necrotic cells.\n\nIn the step method, I need to implement the biological processes. For apoptosis, maybe check a condition and trigger cell death. Necrosis could be similar but with different conditions. Proliferation would involve cell division. Adhesion affects the energy terms, so I'll set adhesion parameters. Contraction might relate to cell volume or membrane fluctuations.\n\nI'll need to set up the simulation parameters: dimensions, steps, neighbor order, etc. Also, define the contact energy between different cell types. For example, healthy cells might have different adhesion energies compared to dead cells.\n\nWait, the user mentioned basic parameters based on the ontology. So, in the start method, set up the cell types using the CellTypePlugin. Then, configure the volume, adhesion, and other plugins accordingly.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Imports: CompuCellSetup, Steppable, steppables, and maybe some plugins like VolumePlugin, ContactPlugin.\n\n2. Simulation class inheriting from SteppableBasePy. In __init__, call the parent constructor. In start, initialize cell types (e.g., Healthy, Apoptotic, Necrotic), set up plugins. In step, handle apoptosis, necrosis, proliferation each step.\n\n3. For apoptosis, maybe each step, loop through cells and with a certain probability, change their type to Apoptotic and set target volume to shrink. Similarly for necrosis.\n\n4. Proliferation could involve checking if a cell's volume is above a threshold and then dividing.\n\n5. Contact energies between different cell types to model adhesion differences.\n\nAlso, make sure to register the steppable with CompuCellSetup at the end.\n\nLet me start writing the code.\n\nImports: from pycellerate import CompuCellSetup, then from some modules import Steppable. Wait, in CompuCell3D, typically you import CompuCellSetup and then from PySteppables import SteppableBasePy, Simulator. Also, the plugins like VolumePlugin, ContactPlugin are configured via the XML or through the Python interface.\n\nWait, the user wants the code to include the necessary imports. So:\n\nimport sys\nfrom PySteppables import *\nimport CompuCellSetup\n\nThen, the simulation class. The start method initializes cell types. Using self.cellTypes, perhaps. Then, setting up volume and contact parameters.\n\nIn the start method, I'll create cell types: Healthy = self.cellTypePlugin.addType('Healthy'), same for Apoptotic and Necrotic. Then, configure the volume plugin parameters (target volume, lambda volume) for each type. Similarly, contact energies between the different types.\n\nIn the step method, loop over cells, check for conditions. For example, for each cell, if random probability is below a threshold (like 0.001), mark for apoptosis. For necrosis, maybe check if the cell's volume is too low, then switch type.\n\nFor proliferation, check if the cell's volume is above a threshold, then call cell.divide().\n\nAlso, handle apoptosis and necrosis by changing cell types and adjusting target volumes. Apoptotic cells might shrink, necrotic cells might lyse.\n\nThe contact energy matrix would have different values between Healthy-Healthy, Healthy-Apoptotic, etc. For example, Healthy cells adhere more strongly to each other, while dead cells have lower adhesion.\n\nPutting it all together, here's the code structure:\n\nimport sys\nfrom PySteppables import *\nimport CompuCellSetup\nimport random\n\nclass SimulationSteppable(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, simulator, frequency=1):\n        SteppableBasePy.__init__(self, simulator, frequency)\n        \n    def start(self):\n        # Define cell types\n        self.Healthy = self.cellTypePlugin.addType('Healthy')\n        self.Apoptotic = self.cellTypePlugin.addType('Apoptotic')\n        self.Necrotic = self.cellTypePlugin.addType('Necrotic')\n        \n        # Configure volume plugin\n        self.volumePlugin.setParams(volume=25, lambdaVolume=2.0, type=self.Healthy)\n        self.volumePlugin.setParams(volume=10, lambdaVolume=5.0, type=self.Apoptotic)\n        self.volumePlugin.setParams(volume=50, lambdaVolume=1.0, type=self.Necrotic)\n        \n        # Configure contact energies\n        self.contactPlugin.setTypeContactEnergy('Healthy', 'Healthy', 15)\n        self.contactPlugin.setTypeContactEnergy('Healthy', 'Apoptotic', 25)\n        self.contactPlugin.setTypeContactEnergy('Healthy', 'Necrotic', 30)\n        self.contactPlugin.setTypeContactEnergy('Apoptotic', 'Apoptotic', 10)\n        self.contactPlugin.setTypeContactEnergy('Apoptotic', 'Necrotic', 20)\n        self.contactPlugin.setTypeContactEnergy('Necrotic', 'Necrotic', 5)\n        \n        # Initial cell setup\n        for i in range(100):\n            cell = self.potts.createCell()\n            cell.type = self.Healthy\n            self.cellField[random.randint(0,100), random.randint(0,100), 0] = cell\n    \n    def step(self, mcs):\n        for cell in self.cellList:\n            # Apoptosis\n            if cell.type == self.Healthy and random.random() < 0.001:\n                cell.type = self.Apoptotic\n                cell.targetVolume = 10\n                cell.lambdaVolume = 5.0\n            # Necrosis\n            elif cell.type == self.Healthy and cell.volume < 15:\n                cell.type = self.Necrotic\n                cell.targetVolume = 50\n                cell.lambdaVolume = 1.0\n            # Proliferation\n            if cell.type == self.Healthy and cell.volume > 30:\n                cell.targetVolume += 25\n                cell.divide()\n        \nCompuCellSetup.registerSteppable(steppable=SimulationSteppable(frequency=1))\n\nHmm, but in CompuCell3D, when you divide a cell, you need to handle the daughter cell. Also, the contact plugin setup might need to be adjusted. The initial cell creation loop places cells randomly in the field. The volumePlugin parameters are set per cell type, which is correct.\n\nAlso, the simulation dimensions and other parameters like Potts setup (steps, temperature, etc.) are usually in the XML. But the user wants the Python code. Wait, in CompuCell3D, the main script is Python, but sometimes the XML is separate. However, the user is asking for the Python code, so maybe the XML parameters are handled via the script.\n\nWait, but the code must be a valid simulation file. Perhaps include the simulator initialization.\n\nWait, maybe I need to set up the simulator in the code. But in typical CompuCell3D scripts, you have a separate XML file. However, the user wants all in the Python code. So perhaps using the CompuCellSetup methods.\n\nAlternatively, the code might need to include the main function. Let me check an example.\n\nWait, in CompuCell3D, the main simulation setup is often done via XML, but through Python, you can configure it. However, the user's code must include all necessary parts. So perhaps:\n\nimport sys\nfrom PySteppables import *\nimport CompuCellSetup\n\nsim, simthread = CompuCellSetup.getCoreSimulationObjects()\n\n# Configure simulator parameters\npotts = sim.getPotts()\npotts.setDimX(100)\npotts.setDimY(100)\npotts.setDimZ(1)\npotts.setSteps(1000)\npotts.setTemperature(10)\npotts.setNeighborOrder(2)\n\nsteppable = SimulationSteppable(sim)\nCompuCellSetup.registerSteppable(steppable)\n\nBut maybe the user expects the code to be the steppable definition and registration, assuming that the main setup is handled elsewhere. However, the user said to return only the Python code, so perhaps including the necessary parts.\n\nWait, the original question says: \"Generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file. Return ONLY the Python code without any additional text...\". So the code should be a complete .py file that can be run with CompuCell3D.\n\nThus, the code needs to import CompuCellSetup, define the steppable class, and register it. However, the main simulation parameters (like Potts setup) are typically in XML. But perhaps the user expects the code to set those"

The model includes both, so those GO terms should be included.\n\nFor MeSH terms, the topics are ductal carcinoma in situ (MeSH D054948), breast neoplasms (D001943), cell proliferation (D002466), apoptosis (D017209), necrosis (D009336), cell adhesion (D002448), and contractility. Contractility might be under \"Muscle Contraction\" (D009121), but since it's about general cell contractility, maybe \"Cell Movement\" (D002465) is better. Alternatively, \"Cell Physiological Processes\" (D002468) as a broader term. But MeSH has \"Cell Adhesion\" (D002448) and \"Cell Proliferation\" (D002466) which are exact matches. For contractility, perhaps \"Cell Movement\" (D002465) is the closest. Alternatively, \"Muscle Contraction\" if the model refers to muscle-like contractility, but the context is mammary cells. Maybe \"Cell Movement\" is safer.\n\nThe original description also mentions tissue morphology terms like micropapillary, cribriform, solid, and comedo. Are these MeSH terms? Checking, \"Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating\" is MeSH D054948 (which is DCIS), but the morphologies themselves might not have specific MeSH terms. Alternatively, \"Breast Neoplasms\" (D001943) is relevant. Since the study is about DCIS progression and tumor cell behavior, terms like Neoplasm Invasiveness (D009361) or Neoplasm Metastasis (D009362) might be applicable, but the text specifically mentions invasion from the ends of ducts regulated by adhesion and contractility. So \"Neoplasm Invasiveness\" (D009361) could be a MeSH term here.\n\nPutting this all together:\n\nCellOntology would have mammary epithelial cells (CL:0002500).\n\nGeneOntology includes terms for cell proliferation (GO:0008283), apoptosis (GO:0006915), necrosis (GO:0070269), cell adhesion (GO:0007155), and cell contraction (GO:0006928).\n\nMeSH terms include Ductal carcinoma in situ (D054948), Breast Neoplasms (D001943), Cell Proliferation (D002466), Apoptosis (D017209), Necrosis (D009336), Cell Adhesion (D002448), and Neoplasm Invasiveness (D009361).\n\nI need to ensure all IDs are correctly formatted without spaces and terms are exact. Let me double-check each ID:\n\n- CL:0002500 is correct for mammary epithelial cell.\n- GO terms: 0008283 (proliferation), 0006915 (apoptosis), 0070269 (necrotic cell death), 0007155 (cell adhesion), 0006928 (cell contraction).\n- MeSH: D054948 (DCIS), D001943 (Breast Neoplasms), D002466 (Cell Proliferation), D017209 (Apoptosis), D009336 (Necrosis), D002448 (Cell Adhesion), D009361 (Neoplasm Invasiveness).\n\nAre there any other terms? The model also mentions tissue geometry and invasion. For MeSH, maybe \"Extracellular Matrix\" (D005109) if adhesion is involved, but the user didn't mention that. The text says invasion regulated by adhesion and contractility, so Neoplasm Invasiveness is appropriate.\n\nI think that covers all the relevant terms mentioned. Now, structure the JSON accordingly, ensuring categories are exact and terms are correctly capitalized without extra spaces.\n</think>",

      "python_code": "from cc3d.core.PySteppables import *\n\n<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a CompuCell3D simulation Python file based on the provided ontology annotations. Let me start by recalling the structure of a typical CompuCell3D script.\n\nFirst, the necessary imports: CompuCellSetup and various modules from steppables. Then, a simulation class that inherits from SteppableBasePy. The class must have __init__, start, and step methods.\n\nLooking at the ontology annotations, the cell type is mammary epithelial cell. The Gene Ontology terms include apoptosis, adhesion, contraction, necrosis, and proliferation. MeSH terms relate to breast neoplasms, proliferation, adhesion, necrosis, apoptosis, and invasiveness.\n\nSo, the simulation should model these processes. In the start method, I'll set up the cell types. The cell types mentioned are mammary epithelial cells and possibly others like necrotic or apoptotic cells. Maybe define different types for healthy, apoptotic, and necrotic cells.\n\nIn the step method, I need to implement the biological processes. For apoptosis, maybe check a condition and trigger cell death. Necrosis could be similar but with different conditions. Proliferation would involve cell division. Adhesion affects the energy terms, so I'll set adhesion parameters. Contraction might relate to cell volume or membrane fluctuations.\n\nI'll need to set up the simulation parameters: dimensions, steps, neighbor order, etc. Also, define the contact energy between different cell types. For example, healthy cells might have different adhesion energies compared to dead cells.\n\nWait, the user mentioned basic parameters based on the ontology. So, in the start method, set up the cell types using the CellTypePlugin. Then, configure the volume, adhesion, and other plugins accordingly.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Imports: CompuCellSetup, Steppable, steppables, and maybe some plugins like VolumePlugin, ContactPlugin.\n\n2. Simulation class inheriting from SteppableBasePy. In __init__, call the parent constructor. In start, initialize cell types (e.g., Healthy, Apoptotic, Necrotic), set up plugins. In step, handle apoptosis, necrosis, proliferation each step.\n\n3. For apoptosis, maybe each step, loop through cells and with a certain probability, change their type to Apoptotic and set target volume to shrink. Similarly for necrosis.\n\n4. Proliferation could involve checking if a cell's volume is above a threshold and then dividing.\n\n5. Contact energies between different cell types to model adhesion differences.\n\nAlso, make sure to register the steppable with CompuCellSetup at the end.\n\nLet me start writing the code.\n\nImports: from pycellerate import CompuCellSetup, then from some modules import Steppable. Wait, in CompuCell3D, typically you import CompuCellSetup and then from PySteppables import SteppableBasePy, Simulator. Also, the plugins like VolumePlugin, ContactPlugin are configured via the XML or through the Python interface.\n\nWait, the user wants the code to include the necessary imports. So:\n\nimport sys\nfrom PySteppables import *\nimport CompuCellSetup\n\nThen, the simulation class. The start method initializes cell types. Using self.cellTypes, perhaps. Then, setting up volume and contact parameters.\n\nIn the start method, I'll create cell types: Healthy = self.cellTypePlugin.addType('Healthy'), same for Apoptotic and Necrotic. Then, configure the volume plugin parameters (target volume, lambda volume) for each type. Similarly, contact energies between the different types.\n\nIn the step method, loop over cells, check for conditions. For example, for each cell, if random probability is below a threshold (like 0.001), mark for apoptosis. For necrosis, maybe check if the cell's volume is too low, then switch type.\n\nFor proliferation, check if the cell's volume is above a threshold, then call cell.divide().\n\nAlso, handle apoptosis and necrosis by changing cell types and adjusting target volumes. Apoptotic cells might shrink, necrotic cells might lyse.\n\nThe contact energy matrix would have different values between Healthy-Healthy, Healthy-Apoptotic, etc. For example, Healthy cells adhere more strongly to each other, while dead cells have lower adhesion.\n\nPutting it all together, here's the code structure:\n\nimport sys\nfrom PySteppables import *\nimport CompuCellSetup\nimport random\n\nclass SimulationSteppable(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, simulator, frequency=1):\n        SteppableBasePy.__init__(self, simulator, frequency)\n        \n    def start(self):\n        # Define cell types\n        self.Healthy = self.cellTypePlugin.addType('Healthy')\n        self.Apoptotic = self.cellTypePlugin.addType('Apoptotic')\n        self.Necrotic = self.cellTypePlugin.addType('Necrotic')\n        \n        # Configure volume plugin\n        self.volumePlugin.setParams(volume=25, lambdaVolume=2.0, type=self.Healthy)\n        self.volumePlugin.setParams(volume=10, lambdaVolume=5.0, type=self.Apoptotic)\n        self.volumePlugin.setParams(volume=50, lambdaVolume=1.0, type=self.Necrotic)\n        \n        # Configure contact energies\n        self.contactPlugin.setTypeContactEnergy('Healthy', 'Healthy', 15)\n        self.contactPlugin.setTypeContactEnergy('Healthy', 'Apoptotic', 25)\n        self.contactPlugin.setTypeContactEnergy('Healthy', 'Necrotic', 30)\n        self.contactPlugin.setTypeContactEnergy('Apoptotic', 'Apoptotic', 10)\n        self.contactPlugin.setTypeContactEnergy('Apoptotic', 'Necrotic', 20)\n        self.contactPlugin.setTypeContactEnergy('Necrotic', 'Necrotic', 5)\n        \n        # Initial cell setup\n        for i in range(100):\n            cell = self.potts.createCell()\n            cell.type = self.Healthy\n            self.cellField[random.randint(0,100), random.randint(0,100), 0] = cell\n    \n    def step(self, mcs):\n        for cell in self.cellList:\n            # Apoptosis\n            if cell.type == self.Healthy and random.random() < 0.001:\n                cell.type = self.Apoptotic\n                cell.targetVolume = 10\n                cell.lambdaVolume = 5.0\n            # Necrosis\n            elif cell.type == self.Healthy and cell.volume < 15:\n                cell.type = self.Necrotic\n                cell.targetVolume = 50\n                cell.lambdaVolume = 1.0\n            # Proliferation\n            if cell.type == self.Healthy and cell.volume > 30:\n                cell.targetVolume += 25\n                cell.divide()\n        \nCompuCellSetup.registerSteppable(steppable=SimulationSteppable(frequency=1))\n\nHmm, but in CompuCell3D, when you divide a cell, you need to handle the daughter cell. Also, the contact plugin setup might need to be adjusted. The initial cell creation loop places cells randomly in the field. The volumePlugin parameters are set per cell type, which is correct.\n\nAlso, the simulation dimensions and other parameters like Potts setup (steps, temperature, etc.) are usually in the XML. But the user wants the Python code. Wait, in CompuCell3D, the main script is Python, but sometimes the XML is separate. However, the user is asking for the Python code, so maybe the XML parameters are handled via the script.\n\nWait, but the code must be a valid simulation file. Perhaps include the simulator initialization.\n\nWait, maybe I need to set up the simulator in the code. But in typical CompuCell3D scripts, you have a separate XML file. However, the user wants all in the Python code. So perhaps using the CompuCellSetup methods.\n\nAlternatively, the code might need to include the main function. Let me check an example.\n\nWait, in CompuCell3D, the main simulation setup is often done via XML, but through Python, you can configure it. However, the user's code must include all necessary parts. So perhaps:\n\nimport sys\nfrom PySteppables import *\nimport CompuCellSetup\n\nsim, simthread = CompuCellSetup.getCoreSimulationObjects()\n\n# Configure simulator parameters\npotts = sim.getPotts()\npotts.setDimX(100)\npotts.setDimY(100)\npotts.setDimZ(1)\npotts.setSteps(1000)\npotts.setTemperature(10)\npotts.setNeighborOrder(2)\n\nsteppable = SimulationSteppable(sim)\nCompuCellSetup.registerSteppable(steppable)\n\nBut maybe the user expects the code to be the steppable definition and registration, assuming that the main setup is handled elsewhere. However, the user said to return only the Python code, so perhaps including the necessary parts.\n\nWait, the original question says: \"Generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file. Return ONLY the Python code without any additional text...\". So the code should be a complete .py file that can be run with CompuCell3D.\n\nThus, the code needs to import CompuCellSetup, define the steppable class, and register it. However, the main simulation parameters (like Potts setup) are typically in XML. But perhaps the user expects the code to set those",
