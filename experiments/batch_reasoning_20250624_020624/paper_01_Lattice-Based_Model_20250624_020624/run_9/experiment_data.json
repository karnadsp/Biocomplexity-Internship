        "description": "Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a heterogeneous group of non-invasive lesions of the breast that result from abnormal proliferation of mammary epithelial cells. Pathologists characterize DCIS by four tissue morphologies (micropapillary, cribriform, solid, and comedo), but the underlying mechanisms that distinguish the development and progression of these morphologies are not well understood. Here we explored the conditions leading to the emergence of the different morphologies of DCIS using a two-dimensional multi-cell lattice-based model that incorporates cell proliferation, apoptosis, necrosis, adhesion, and contractility. We found that the relative rates of cell proliferation and apoptosis governed which of the four morphologies emerged. High proliferation and low apoptosis favored the emergence of solid and comedo morphologies. In contrast, low proliferation and high apoptosis led to the micropapillary morphology, whereas high proliferation and high apoptosis led to the cribriform morphology. The natural progression between morphologies cannot be investigated in vivo since lesions are usually surgically removed upon detection; however, our model suggests probable transitions between these morphologies during breast cancer progression. Importantly, cribriform and comedo appear to be the ultimate morphologies of DCIS. Motivated by previous experimental studies demonstrating that tumor cells behave differently depending on where they are located within the mammary duct in vivo or in engineered tissues, we examined the effects of tissue geometry on the progression of DCIS. In agreement with our previous experimental work, we found that cells are more likely to invade from the end of ducts and that this preferential invasion is regulated by cell adhesion and contractility. This model provides additional insight into tumor cell behavior and allows the exploration of phenotypic transitions not easily monitored in vivo."

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants a JSON object with structured ontology annotations for the provided biological description of Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS). The key points are to include CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH terms where applicable, following strict formatting rules.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original description to identify relevant terms. The text mentions \"mammary epithelial cells\" which points to a Cell Ontology term. Searching for the correct CL ID, \"CL:0000066\" corresponds to \"Epithelial Cell of Mammary Gland\".\n\nNext, for Gene Ontology, the processes involved are cell proliferation (GO:0008283), apoptosis (GO:0006915), adhesion (GO:0007155), and contractility. Contractility might be under \"Actomyosin contractility\" (GO:0031032). These should be checked for exact IDs and terms.\n\nMeSH terms would include \"Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating\" (D018301) for DCIS. \"Cell Proliferation\" (D002460) and \"Apoptosis\" (D017209) are also mentioned. Additionally, \"Necrosis\" (D009336) and \"Cell Adhesion\" (D015815) are relevant. Ensuring the MeSH IDs are correctly formatted without spaces is crucial.\n\nI need to verify each term's ID and exact spelling. For example, \"Epithelial Cell of Mammary Gland\" is the precise term for CL:0000066. For Gene Ontology, \"Actomyosin contractility\" is the correct term for GO:0031032. Also, confirming that MeSH terms like \"Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating\" match the given description.\n\nFinally, structure the JSON object with categories exactly named as specified: \"CellOntology\", \"GeneOntology\", \"MeSH\". Each entry includes the ID without spaces and the exact term name. Avoid any extra explanations and ensure the JSON syntax is correct.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000066\",\n            \"term\": \"Epithelial Cell of Mammary Gland\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0008283\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Proliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0006915\",\n            \"term\": \"Apoptosis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007155\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0031032\",\n            \"term\": \"Actomyosin contractility\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D018301\",\n            \"term\": \"Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002460\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Proliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D017209\",\n            \"term\": \"Apoptosis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D009336\",\n            \"term\": \"Necrosis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D015815\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Adhesion\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"

Let me start by recalling the structure of a typical CompuCell3D script.\n\nFirst, the necessary imports: CompuCellSetup and steppables from the cc3d library. Then, a simulation class that inherits from SteppableBasePy. The class should have __init__, start, and step methods.\n\nLooking at the ontology annotations, the cell type is Epithelial Cell of Mammary Gland. So I'll define that as a cell type. The GeneOntology terms include Actomyosin contractility, Cell Proliferation, Apoptosis, and Cell Adhesion. MeSH terms add Necrosis and Carcinoma, which might relate to cell behaviors like death or tumor formation.\n\nIn the start method, I need to initialize the cell types. Using self.cell_type_epithelial = self.new_cell_type(\"Epithelial\") makes sense. Then set up the volume and adhesion parameters. For actomyosin, maybe set target_volume and lambda_volume. Adhesion parameters would use the add_adhesion_energy method.\n\nFor cell behaviors: Proliferation could be handled in the step method by checking if a cell's volume exceeds a threshold and then dividing. Apoptosis and Necrosis can be modeled by changing the target volume to induce shrinkage. Maybe in step, check a random condition to trigger apoptosis (like cell.targetVolume = 0) or necrosis (cell.targetVolume = 0, but maybe with a different condition).\n\nThe Carcinoma term might mean introducing a new cell type, but the ontology mentions \"Noninfiltrating\", so maybe just a property of the existing epithelial cells. Maybe not necessary to create a new type unless specified.\n\nIn the step method, every certain number of steps (mod 100), check for cells to divide, or trigger death. For adhesion, the energy parameters are set in start, so no action needed in step beyond that.\n\nI should also set up the simulation with CompuCellSetup.register_steppable and run it.\n\nNow putting this into code.
