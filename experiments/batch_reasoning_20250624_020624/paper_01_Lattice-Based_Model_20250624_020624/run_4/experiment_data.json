Pathologists characterize DCIS by four tissue morphologies (micropapillary, cribriform, solid, and comedo), but the underlying mechanisms that distinguish the development and progression of these morphologies are not well understood. Here we explored the conditions leading to the emergence of the different morphologies of DCIS using a two-dimensional multi-cell lattice-based model that incorporates cell proliferation, apoptosis, necrosis, adhesion, and contractility. We found that the relative rates of cell proliferation and apoptosis governed which of the four morphologies emerged. High proliferation and low apoptosis favored the emergence of solid and comedo morphologies. In contrast, low proliferation and high apoptosis led to the micropapillary morphology, whereas high proliferation and high apoptosis led to the cribriform morphology. The natural progression between morphologies cannot be investigated in vivo since lesions are usually surgically removed upon detection; however, our model suggests probable transitions between these morphologies during breast cancer progression. Importantly, cribriform and comedo appear to be the ultimate morphologies of DCIS. Motivated by previous experimental studies demonstrating that tumor cells behave differently depending on where they are located within the mammary duct in vivo or in engineered tissues, we examined the effects of tissue geometry on the progression of DCIS. In agreement with our previous experimental work, we found that cells are more likely to invade from the end of ducts and that this preferential invasion is regulated by cell adhesion and contractility. This model provides additional insight into tumor cell behavior and allows the exploration of phenotypic transitions not easily monitored in vivo."

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by breaking down the problem. The user wants structured ontology annotations based on the provided information about Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). They specified three categories: CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH. Each needs exact IDs and term names without extra spaces.\n\nFirst, looking at the original description. The main cell type mentioned is mammary epithelial cells. So for CellOntology, I need to find the correct CL ID. The term \"mammary epithelial cell\" should correspond to CL:0000188. Let me verify that. Yes, CL:0000188 is indeed the mammary epithelial cell.\n\nNext, GeneOntology terms. The processes mentioned include cell proliferation, apoptosis, adhesion, contractility, and necrosis. Let's map these to GO terms. Cell proliferation is GO:0008283. Apoptosis is GO:0006915. Cell adhesion is GO:0007155. Contractility might be muscle contraction, but here it's about cell contractility, so perhaps GO:0030054 for cell-matrix adhesion? Wait, maybe actomyosin contractility? Alternatively, cell motility? Hmm, the model includes contractility as a parameter affecting invasion. Maybe GO:0030032 for lamellipodium assembly involved in cell motility? Or is there a more precise term? Alternatively, contractility as part of the cytoskeleton organization. Let me check. GO:0030031 for cell projection assembly? Alternatively, \"cell contractility\" might not have a direct GO term. Wait, the model includes cell adhesion and contractility. Adhesion is straightforward. For contractility, maybe \"cell migration\" (GO:0016477) or \"cell motility\" (GO:0048870)? Alternatively, \"cellular mechanical behavior\" terms. Hmm. Alternatively, if it's about actomyosin contractility, then GO:0030048 is actin filament-based movement. Alternatively, perhaps \"regulation of cell shape\" (GO:0008360). But the user mentioned contractility as a factor influencing invasion, so maybe cell migration is more relevant. Let's go with cell migration (GO:0016477). Necrosis is GO:0070269. So compiling these: proliferation (GO:0008283), apoptosis (GO:0006915), adhesion (GO:0007155), migration (GO:0016477), necrosis (GO:0070269).\n\nFor MeSH terms, the main topics are Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (MeSH D054948), Breast Neoplasms (D001943), Cell Proliferation (D049630), Apoptosis (D017209), and Neoplasm Invasiveness (D009362). Checking MeSH terms, yes: DCIS is D054948, Breast Neoplasms D001943, Cell Proliferation D049630, Apoptosis D017209, and Neoplasm Invasiveness D009362. Also, maybe \"Cell Adhesion\" as D015815. Since the model examines adhesion and contractility in invasion, including Cell Adhesion would make sense. So MeSH terms would be those.\n\nNow, ensure that all IDs are correctly formatted without spaces. For example, CL:0000188, not CL: 0000188. Similarly for GO and MeSH terms. Also, check term names for exactness. \"Mammary epithelial cell\" is correct for CL term. For GO, \"Cell Proliferation\", \"Apoptotic Process\", \"Cell Adhesion\", \"Necrotic Cell Death\", \"Cell Migration\". Wait, the GO term for apoptosis is actually named \"apoptotic process\" (GO:0006915), so the term should be \"Apoptotic Process\". Similarly, necrosis is \"Necrotic Cell Death\" (GO:0070269). Cell Migration is correct as \"Cell Migration\" (GO:0016477).\n\nSo compiling all:\n\nCellOntology: [{\"id\": \"CL:0000188\", \"term\": \"mammary epithelial cell\"}]\n\nGeneOntology: [\n  {\"id\": \"GO:0008283\", \"term\": \"Cell Proliferation\"},\n  {\"id\": \"GO:0006915\", \"term\": \"Apoptotic Process\"},\n  {\"id\": \"GO:0007155\", \"term\": \"Cell Adhesion\"},\n  {\"id\": \"GO:0070269\", \"term\": \"Necrotic Cell Death\"},\n  {\"id\": \"GO:0016477\", \"term\": \"Cell Migration\"}\n]\n\nMeSH: [\n  {\"id\": \"D054948\", \"term\": \"Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating\"},\n  {\"id\": \"D001943\", \"term\": \"Breast Neoplasms\"},\n  {\"id\": \"D049630\", \"term\": \"Cell Proliferation\"},\n  {\"id\": \"D017209\", \"term\": \"Apoptosis\"},\n  {\"id\": \"D009362\", \"term\": \"Neoplasm Invasiveness\"},\n  {\"id\": \"D015815\", \"term\": \"Cell Adhesion\"}\n]\n\nWait, checking MeSH term for DCIS: The exact term in MeSH is \"Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating\" (D054948), which is DCIS. So that's correct. Also, \"Breast Neoplasms\" is D001943. \"Cell Proliferation\" is D049630. \"Apoptosis\" D017209. \"Neoplasm Invasiveness\" D009362. \"Cell Adhesion\" D015815. All correct.\n\nMake sure there are no extra spaces in the term names. For example, \"Apoptotic Process\" is correct, not \"ApoptoticProcess\". Similarly, \"Necrotic Cell Death\" is the correct term. \"Cell Migration\" is correct. For MeSH terms, \"Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating\" is the exact term.\n\nNow, structure the JSON exactly as per the example, with the categories named exactly as specified. No extra fields or explanations. Only the JSON object.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000188\",\n            \"term\": \"mammary epithelial cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0008283\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Proliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0006915\",\n            \"term\": \"Apoptotic Process\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007155\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0070269\",\n            \"term\": \"Necrotic Cell Death\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0016477\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Migration\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D054948\",\n            \"term\": \"Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D001943\",\n            \"term\": \"Breast Neoplasms\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D049630\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Proliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D017209\",\n            \"term\": \"Apoptosis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D009362\",\n            \"term\": \"Neoplasm Invasiveness\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D015815\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Adhesion\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```"

The Gene Ontology terms are things like proliferation, migration, apoptosis, necrosis, and adhesion. MeSH terms add things like carcinoma and breast neoplasms.
