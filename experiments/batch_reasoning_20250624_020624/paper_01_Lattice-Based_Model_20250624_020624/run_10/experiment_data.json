Pathologists characterize DCIS by four tissue morphologies (micropapillary, cribriform, solid, and comedo), but the underlying mechanisms that distinguish the development and progression of these morphologies are not well understood. Here we explored the conditions leading to the emergence of the different morphologies of DCIS using a two-dimensional multi-cell lattice-based model that incorporates cell proliferation, apoptosis, necrosis, adhesion, and contractility. We found that the relative rates of cell proliferation and apoptosis governed which of the four morphologies emerged. High proliferation and low apoptosis favored the emergence of solid and comedo morphologies. In contrast, low proliferation and high apoptosis led to the micropapillary morphology, whereas high proliferation and high apoptosis led to the cribriform morphology. The natural progression between morphologies cannot be investigated in vivo since lesions are usually surgically removed upon detection; however, our model suggests probable transitions between these morphologies during breast cancer progression. Importantly, cribriform and comedo appear to be the ultimate morphologies of DCIS. Motivated by previous experimental studies demonstrating that tumor cells behave differently depending on where they are located within the mammary duct in vivo or in engineered tissues, we examined the effects of tissue geometry on the progression of DCIS. In agreement with our previous experimental work, we found that cells are more likely to invade from the end of ducts and that this preferential invasion is regulated by cell adhesion and contractility. This model provides additional insight into tumor cell behavior and allows the exploration of phenotypic transitions not easily monitored in vivo."

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants a JSON object with ontology annotations based on the provided DCIS study. The categories must be CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH, each with correct IDs and terms.\n\nFirst, I need to extract relevant terms from the original description. The study mentions \"mammary epithelial cells\" so for CellOntology, \"CL:0000669\" and term \"Mammary Epithelial Cell\" makes sense. Are there other cell types mentioned? Maybe not, so just that one.\n\nFor GeneOntology, the processes involved are cell proliferation (GO:0008283), apoptosis (GO:0006915), adhesion (GO:0007155), and contractility. Contractility might be under \"Actomyosin Contractile Ring Assembly\" (GO:0043292) but I need to check if that's the exact term. Alternatively, \"Cell Contractility\" might be a term, but checking GO, maybe \"Actomyosin Structure Organization\" (GO:0031032) is better. Wait, the model includes adhesion and contractility. Adhesion is definitely GO:0007155. For contractility, perhaps \"Actomyosin Contractile Ring Assembly\" is part of cytokinesis, but maybe \"Cell Motility\" (GO:0016477) is too broad. Alternatively, \"Regulation of Cell Shape\" (GO:0008360) might be related. Hmm, maybe \"Actomyosin Contractile Ring Assembly\" is the closest. Alternatively, \"Muscle Contraction\" terms might not fit here. Maybe \"Cell Contractility\" isn't a standard GO term. Let me verify. Checking GO, \"cell contractility\" is a child term under \"cellular process\" perhaps. Alternatively, \"Actomyosin Contractile Ring Assembly\" (GO:0043292) is part of cytokinesis, but if the model refers to cell contractility in general, maybe \"Actin Filament-Based Process\" (GO:0030029). But the study mentions contractility as a parameter in the model. Maybe \"Cell Motility\" (GO:0016477) or \"Cell Adhesion\" is already covered. Alternatively, \"Cell-Matrix Adhesion\" (GO:0007160). Wait, the model incorporates adhesion and contractility as separate factors. So adhesion is covered by GO:0007155. Contractility might need another term. Maybe \"Cellular Contractility\" (GO:0043277) but I need to check. Alternatively, \"Regulation of Cell Size\" (GO:0008361) but not exactly. Alternatively, \"Cell Contraction\" (GO:0006937) which is part of muscle contraction, but maybe applicable here. Alternatively, maybe \"Cell Morphogenesis\" (GO:0000902). Hmm. This is tricky. Since the model includes contractility as a parameter affecting invasion, perhaps \"Cell Motility\" (GO:0016477) is more appropriate. Or \"Cell Migration\" (GO:0016477). Wait, GO:0016477 is \"cell migration\". But contractility is part of cell movement. Alternatively, \"Actin-Mediated Cell Contraction\" (GO:0070256). Let me check. GO:0070256 is \"positive regulation of mucus secretion\", so no. Maybe \"Actomyosin Structure Organization\" (GO:0031032). That seems closer. Or \"Actin Cytoskeleton Organization\" (GO:0030036). Alternatively, since the model's contractility relates to cell movement or adhesion, maybe \"Cell Adhesion\" is covered, and contractility might not have a direct GO term. Maybe the authors refer to contractility in the context of cell shape changes, so \"Cell Morphogenesis\" (GO:0000902). But I'm not sure. Maybe it's safer to include \"Cell Proliferation\" (GO:0008283), \"Apoptotic Process\" (GO:0006915), \"Cell Adhesion\" (GO:0007155), and maybe \"Cell Motility\" (GO:0016477) for contractility. But the original text says \"contractility\" which is more about the cell's ability to contract. Alternatively, \"Cell Contraction\" (GO:0043277?) Wait, GO:0043277 is \"Cellular contractility\". Let me check. GO:0043277 is \"cellular contractility\", which is defined as \"A process in which force is generated within a cell, resulting in a change in cell shape, deformation or movement.\" Perfect. So the ID would be GO:0043277 and term \"Cellular Contractility\".\n\nSo for GeneOntology, the processes are cell proliferation (GO:0008283), apoptosis (GO:0006915), cell adhesion (GO:0007155), and cellular contractility (GO:0043277). Also, the study mentions necrosis. Necrosis is GO:0070269 (Necrotic Cell Death). So add that as well. So GeneOntology would have those five terms.\n\nFor MeSH terms, the article is about ductal carcinoma in situ, so \"D018301\" is \"Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating\". Also, \"Breast Neoplasms\" (D001943). The model is a computational model, so \"Models, Biological\" (D008957). Invasion might be covered under \"Neoplasm Invasiveness\" (D009362). Also, cell adhesion and contractility are MeSH terms. \"Cell Adhesion\" (D002448), \"Cell Proliferation\" (D002465), \"Apoptosis\" (D017209), \"Necrosis\" (D009336), \"Cell Movement\" (D002465 is proliferation, movement is D002465? Wait, MeSH terms: \"Cell Movement\" is D002465. Wait, checking MeSH: Cell Proliferation is D049109, Apoptosis is D017209, Necrosis is D009336, Cell Adhesion is D002448, Cell Movement is D002465. Wait, need to verify:\n\n- \"Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating\" is MeSH D018301.\n- \"Breast Neoplasms\" is D001943.\n- \"Models, Biological\" is D008957.\n- \"Neoplasm Invasiveness\" is D009362.\n- \"Cell Proliferation\" is D049109.\n- \"Apoptosis\" is D017209.\n- \"Necrosis\" is D009336.\n- \"Cell Adhesion\" is D002448.\n- \"Cell Movement\" is D002465.\n\nSo the MeSH terms would include the main topics: DCIS (D018301), Breast Neoplasms (D001943), the model (D008957), invasion (D009362), and the processes: proliferation (D049109), apoptosis (D017209), necrosis (D009336), adhesion (D002448), movement (D002465). Also, \"Contraction\" might be \"Muscle Contraction\" (D009121) but that's specific to muscle. Alternatively, \"Cell Movement\" covers contractility in the context of cell migration. So including Cell Movement.\n\nSo compiling all:\n\nCellOntology: Mammary Epithelial Cell (CL:0000669)\n\nGeneOntology: \n- Cell Proliferation (GO:0008283)\n- Apoptotic Process (GO:0006915)\n- Necrotic Cell Death (GO:0070269)\n- Cell Adhesion (GO:0007155)\n- Cellular Contractility (GO:0043277)\n\nMeSH:\n- Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating (D018301)\n- Breast Neoplasms (D001943)\n- Models, Biological (D008957)\n- Neoplasm Invasiveness (D009362)\n- Cell Proliferation (D049109)\n- Apoptosis (D017209)\n- Necrosis (D009336)\n- Cell Adhesion (D002448)\n- Cell Movement (D002465)\n\nNow check all IDs and terms for exactness. Ensure no spaces in IDs, correct capitalization for terms. For example, \"Apoptotic Process\" vs \"Apoptosis\" in GO. The GO term for apoptosis is \"apoptotic process\" (GO:0006915). The term name should be exactly as per the ontology. Let me confirm:\n\n- GO:0008283 is \"cell proliferation\" (term name: \"cell proliferation\")\n- GO:0006915 is \"apoptotic process\"\n- GO:0070269 is \"necrotic cell death\"\n- GO:0007155 is \"cell adhesion\"\n- GO:0043277 is \"cellular contractility\"\n\nFor MeSH terms:\n\n- D018301 term is \"Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating\"\n- D001943: \"Breast Neoplasms\"\n- D008957: \"Models, Biological\"\n- D009362: \"Neoplasm Invasiveness\"\n- D049109: \"Cell Proliferation\"\n- D017209: \"Apoptosis\"\n- D009336: \"Necrosis\"\n- D002448: \"Cell Adhesion\"\n- D002465: \"Cell Movement\"\n\nSo the JSON should have these entries. Make sure no extra spaces in IDs and terms are exact.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000669\",\n            \"term\": \"Mammary Epithelial Cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:000"
