        "description": "Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a heterogeneous group of non-invasive lesions of the breast that result from abnormal proliferation of mammary epithelial cells. Pathologists characterize DCIS by four tissue morphologies (micropapillary, cribriform, solid, and comedo), but the underlying mechanisms that distinguish the development and progression of these morphologies are not well understood. Here we explored the conditions leading to the emergence of the different morphologies of DCIS using a two-dimensional multi-cell lattice-based model that incorporates cell proliferation, apoptosis, necrosis, adhesion, and contractility. We found that the relative rates of cell proliferation and apoptosis governed which of the four morphologies emerged. High proliferation and low apoptosis favored the emergence of solid and comedo morphologies. In contrast, low proliferation and high apoptosis led to the micropapillary morphology, whereas high proliferation and high apoptosis led to the cribriform morphology. The natural progression between morphologies cannot be investigated in vivo since lesions are usually surgically removed upon detection; however, our model suggests probable transitions between these morphologies during breast cancer progression. Importantly, cribriform and comedo appear to be the ultimate morphologies of DCIS. Motivated by previous experimental studies demonstrating that tumor cells behave differently depending on where they are located within the mammary duct in vivo or in engineered tissues, we examined the effects of tissue geometry on the progression of DCIS. In agreement with our previous experimental work, we found that cells are more likely to invade from the end of ducts and that this preferential invasion is regulated by cell adhesion and contractility. This model provides additional insight into tumor cell behavior and allows the exploration of phenotypic transitions not easily monitored in vivo."

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants a JSON object with ontology annotations based on the provided description of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The categories must be CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH, each with their respective IDs and terms.\n\nFirst, looking at the original description. The main cell type mentioned is mammary epithelial cells. So for CellOntology, I need to find the correct CL ID for mammary epithelial cells. Checking the Cell Ontology, the term is \"mammary epithelial cell\" with ID CL:0002493. That should go under CellOntology.\n\nNext, GeneOntology. The processes mentioned include cell proliferation, apoptosis, necrosis, adhesion, and contractility. Let's map each to GO terms. \n\n- Cell proliferation: GO:0008283 (cell population proliferation)\n- Apoptosis: GO:0006915 (apoptotic process)\n- Necrosis: GO:0070269 (necrotic cell death)\n- Cell adhesion: GO:0007155 (cell adhesion)\n- Contractility might be part of cell motility or muscle contraction, but since the context is cell contractility, perhaps GO:0030030 (cell projection organization) or something more specific. Wait, maybe \"cell contractility\" isn't a direct GO term. Alternatively, looking for terms related to cytoskeleton contraction. Hmm, GO:0043292 (contractile fiber) might be part of that. Alternatively, \"cell migration\" could be related. Alternatively, since the model involves contractility affecting invasion, maybe \"cell motility\" (GO:0048870). But the description specifically mentions contractility, so maybe GO:0030049 (muscle filament sliding), but that's muscle-specific. Maybe GO:0006936 (muscle contraction), but again, muscle. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps \"actomyosin contractility\" which might not have a direct GO term. Maybe \"regulation of cell shape\" (GO:0008360) or \"cell morphogenesis\" (GO:0000902). Alternatively, check if there's a term for contractility. Alternatively, perhaps the user refers to cellular contractility in the context of movement, so cell motility (GO:0048870). But the exact term is tricky. Maybe it's better to include cell adhesion and motility terms. Alternatively, maybe \"cell-cell adhesion\" (GO:0016337) is separate. Wait, the original mentions adhesion and contractility. For adhesion, GO:0007155 is correct. For contractility, maybe \"cell motility\" (GO:0048870) or \"cell migration\" (GO:0016477). Alternatively, \"positive regulation of cell migration\" (GO:0030335). But since the model includes contractility as a factor, perhaps \"regulation of cell migration\" (GO:0030334). Hmm. Maybe better to check the exact terms. Alternatively, perhaps the contractility here refers to actin-mediated processes. Maybe \"actin-mediated cell contraction\" (GO:0030256). Wait, GO:0030256 is \"regulation of lipid metabolic process\", which is not. Let me check. Maybe GO:0030041 (actin filament polymerization). Alternatively, perhaps \"cellular contractile fiber\" (GO:0043292). But I'm not sure. Since the user example used \"Cell Division\" as a term, maybe they expect more general terms. Alternatively, maybe the contractility here is part of cell motility. Alternatively, maybe it's best to include the terms explicitly mentioned: proliferation, apoptosis, necrosis, adhesion. Contractility might not have a direct GO term, so perhaps omit it unless there's a specific term. Let me confirm. Let's check GO for contractility. Searching GO for \"contractility\", I find GO:0055116 (regulation of contractility) but that's for heart. Maybe \"cell contractility\" isn't a standard GO term. So perhaps it's better to stick with the processes explicitly mentioned. So include cell proliferation (GO:0008283), apoptosis (GO:0006915), necrosis (GO:0070269), adhesion (GO:0007155). Contractility might not have a direct term, so maybe skip that unless there's a better fit. Alternatively, if the model includes cell migration or invasion, those could be considered. The description mentions invasion at the end, so maybe \"cell invasion\" (GO:0016477). But the original text says \"invasion from the end of ducts\" and \"regulated by cell adhesion and contractility\". So maybe cell migration (GO:0016477) and cell adhesion (GO:0007155). So adding cell migration. So GeneOntology would have those five: proliferation, apoptosis, necrosis, adhesion, migration.\n\nFor MeSH terms, the main topics are ductal carcinoma in situ (MeSH D018301), breast neoplasms (D001943), cell proliferation (D002460), apoptosis (D017209), necrosis (D009336), cell adhesion (D015815), and possibly others like neoplasm invasiveness (D009362) or morphogenesis (D009024). The description discusses tumor cell behavior, invasion, tissue geometry. So MeSH terms could include \"Ductal Carcinoma in Situ\" (D018301), \"Breast Neoplasms\" (D001943), \"Cell Proliferation\" (D002460), \"Apoptosis\" (D017209), \"Necrosis\" (D009336), \"Cell Adhesion\" (D015815), \"Neoplasm Invasiveness\" (D009362), \"Morphogenesis\" (D009024), and maybe \"Tumor Microenvironment\" (D064888). Also, \"Cell Movement\" (D002465) could be relevant for invasion. Let's check the MeSH IDs. \n\n- Ductal carcinoma in situ: D018301\n- Breast neoplasms: D001943\n- Cell proliferation: D002460\n- Apoptosis: D017209\n- Necrosis: D009336\n- Cell adhesion: D015815\n- Neoplasm invasiveness: D009362\n- Morphogenesis: D009024\n- Cell movement: D002465\n\nSo MeSH terms would include these. \n\nNow, formatting the JSON. Make sure the category names are exact: CellOntology, GeneOntology, MeSH. IDs without spaces. Terms without extra spaces. \n\nFor CellOntology:\n- CL:0002493 for mammary epithelial cell.\n\nGeneOntology:\n- GO:0008283 (cell population proliferation)\n- GO:0006915 (apoptotic process)\n- GO:0070269 (necrotic cell death)\n- GO:0007155 (cell adhesion)\n- GO:0016477 (cell migration)\n\nMeSH:\n- D018301 (Ductal Carcinoma in Situ)\n- D001943 (Breast Neoplasms)\n- D002460 (Cell Proliferation)\n- D017209 (Apoptosis)\n- D009336 (Necrosis)\n- D015815 (Cell Adhesion)\n- D009362 (Neoplasm Invasiveness)\n- D002465 (Cell Movement)\n\nWait, the example in the user message has the term names as \"Cell Division\" instead of \"cell division\" (lowercase). So need to check the exact term capitalization. For example, Gene Ontology terms are usually capitalized. So \"Cell population proliferation\" is actually \"cell population proliferation\" in GO, but the example uses \"Cell Division\" (capitalized). Maybe the user expects the term as it's written in the ontology. Let me check:\n\nGO:0008283 is \"cell population proliferation\". The term is in lowercase in GO. However, in the example given, the user wrote \"Cell Division\" with capital letters. But the user's instruction says \"Term names must be exact without extra spaces\". So we need to use the exact term name as per the ontology. So \"cell population proliferation\" (lowercase). But wait, the example in the user's message has \"Cell Division\" which is correct because the actual GO term is \"cell division\" (GO:0051301), but in the example, it's written as \"Cell Division\". Wait, that's inconsistent. Let me check GO:0000000 in the example is a placeholder. The actual term for cell division is GO:0051301 with term \"cell division\". So in the example, they capitalized it, but according to the user's instruction, terms must be exact. Therefore, the user's example might have a mistake, but we need to follow the exact term names. So for GO:0008283, the term is \"cell population proliferation\". So lowercase. But maybe in some ontologies, terms are capitalized. Need to confirm. \n\nWait, the Gene Ontology uses lowercase for terms. For example, \"apoptotic process\" (GO:0006915). So we need to use the exact term as per GO, which is lowercase. However, in the user's example, they used \"Cell Division\" with capital letters, which might be incorrect. But the user's example is just an example, and the instruction says to use exact terms. So we must use the exact term names from the ontologies. Therefore, \"cell population proliferation\", \"apoptotic process\", \"necrotic cell death\", \"cell adhesion\", \"cell migration\".\n\nFor MeSH terms, the MeSH terms are capitalized. For example, \"Ductal Carcinoma in Situ\", \"Breast Neoplasms\", \"Cell Proliferation\", \"Apoptosis\", \"Necrosis\", \"Cell Adhesion\", \""
