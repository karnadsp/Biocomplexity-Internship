Pathologists characterize DCIS by four tissue morphologies (micropapillary, cribriform, solid, and comedo), but the underlying mechanisms that distinguish the development and progression of these morphologies are not well understood. Here we explored the conditions leading to the emergence of the different morphologies of DCIS using a two-dimensional multi-cell lattice-based model that incorporates cell proliferation, apoptosis, necrosis, adhesion, and contractility. We found that the relative rates of cell proliferation and apoptosis governed which of the four morphologies emerged.

In contrast, low proliferation and high apoptosis led to the micropapillary morphology, whereas high proliferation and high apoptosis led to the cribriform morphology. The natural progression between morphologies cannot be investigated in vivo since lesions are usually surgically removed upon detection; however, our model suggests probable transitions between these morphologies during breast cancer progression. Importantly, cribriform and comedo appear to be the ultimate morphologies of DCIS. Motivated by previous experimental studies demonstrating that tumor cells behave differently depending on where they are located within the mammary duct in vivo or in engineered tissues, we examined the effects of tissue geometry on the progression of DCIS. In agreement with our previous experimental work, we found that cells are more likely to invade from the end of ducts and that this preferential invasion is regulated by cell adhesion and contractility. This model provides additional insight into tumor cell behavior and allows the exploration of phenotypic transitions not easily monitored in vivo."

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a structured JSON object with ontology annotations based on the provided information about Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Let me start by parsing the original description and identifying relevant terms for each ontology category: CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH.\n\nFirst, for CellOntology, the text mentions \"mammary epithelial cells.\" The Cell Ontology term for that is \"mammary epithelial cell\" with ID CL:0000062. Also, since DCIS is a type of carcinoma in situ, maybe \"carcinoma in situ\" is a term here, but I need to check if that's in Cell Ontology. The Cell Ontology entry for \"carcinoma cell\" is CL:0001064. Alternatively, \"ductal cell\" might be relevant. Wait, CL:0000092 is \"epithelial cell of mammary gland,\" which is probably more precise. I should confirm the exact term and ID. Let me check: CL:0000092 is \"mammary gland epithelial cell,\" so that's correct. So adding that.\n\nNext, GeneOntology. The processes mentioned include cell proliferation (GO:0008283), apoptosis (GO:0006915), adhesion (GO:0007155), and contractility. Contractility might correspond to \"cell contractility\" which is GO:0045059. Also, necrosis is mentioned, but necrosis is more like a result rather than a process. The process leading to necrosis might be \"necrotic cell death\" (GO:0070269). But the text mentions necrosis as a factor in the model, so maybe \"negative regulation of cell death\" (GO:0060548) or similar. Wait, apoptosis is already covered. The model incorporates cell proliferation, apoptosis, necrosis, adhesion, and contractility. So for GeneOntology, those processes: cell proliferation (GO:0008283), apoptosis (GO:0006915), cell adhesion (GO:0007155), and cell contractility (GO:0045059). Necrosis might not have a direct GO term here, but maybe \"regulation of necrotic cell death\" (GO:0010944), but the text just mentions necrosis. Alternatively, \"necroptosis\" is a programmed form, but the text says necrosis. Since the model includes necrosis, perhaps \"necrotic cell death\" (GO:0070269) is appropriate. Wait, the exact term in GO for necrosis is \"necrotic cell death\" with ID GO:0070269. So I should include that. So GeneOntology terms would be cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell adhesion, cell contractility, and necrotic cell death.\n\nFor MeSH terms, the main topics are Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (MeSH term is \"Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating\" with ID D018301). Also mentioned are cell proliferation (MeSH D002470), apoptosis (D017209), necrosis (D009336), cell adhesion (D015815), and contractility (D003326). Tissue morphology terms like micropapillary, cribriform, solid, comedo might not be MeSH terms, but the disease itself is D018301. So MeSH entries would include the carcinoma term, cell proliferation, apoptosis, necrosis, cell adhesion, and contractility.\n\nNow, I need to ensure the IDs and terms are exact. Let me double-check each term's ID.\n\nCellOntology:\n- \"mammary epithelial cell\" is CL:0000092. Wait, checking the Cell Ontology, CL:0000092 is \"mammary gland epithelial cell.\" Yes, that's correct.\n\nGeneOntology:\n- Cell proliferation: GO:0008283 (correct).\n- Apoptosis: GO:0006915 is \"apoptotic process,\" which is the correct term.\n- Cell adhesion: GO:0007155 is \"cell adhesion.\"\n- Cell contractility: GO:0045059 is \"cell contractility.\"\n- Necrotic cell death: GO:0070269 is correct.\n\nMeSH:\n- Ductal carcinoma in situ: D018301 for \"Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating.\"\n- Cell proliferation: D002470.\n- Apoptosis: D017209.\n- Necrosis: D009336.\n- Cell adhesion: D015815.\n- Contractility: D003326 (for \"Cell Contractility\" as a MeSH term).\n\nAll terms and IDs seem correct. Now, structure the JSON according to the categories. Make sure category names are exact: CellOntology, GeneOntology, MeSH. No extra spaces in terms or IDs. Let me compile the JSON accordingly.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000092\",\n            \"term\": \"mammary gland epithelial cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0008283\",\n            \"term\": \"cell proliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0006915\",\n            \"term\": \"apoptotic process\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007155\",\n            \"term\": \"cell adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0045059\",\n            \"term\": \"cell contractility\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0070269\",\n            \"term\": \"necrotic cell death\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D018301\",\n            \"term\": \"Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002470\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Proliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D017209\",\n            \"term\": \"Apoptosis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D009336\",\n            \"term\": \"Necrosis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D015815\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D003326\",\n            \"term\": \"Contractility\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out how to generate the CompuCell3D simulation file based on the given ontology annotations. The user wants a Python script that includes specific elements: necessary imports, a simulation class inheriting from SteppableBasePy, and the required methods like __init__, start, and step. Also, the code must incorporate basic cell types and parameters from the provided ontologies.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the structure of a typical CompuCell3D simulation script. The imports usually include CompuCellSetup and various modules from PySteppables. The simulation class typically inherits from SteppableBasePy and overrides methods like start and step. The cell types are defined in the start method, and parameters related to cell behaviors are set there as well.\n\nLooking at the ontology annotations: the cell type is mammary gland epithelial cell. The Gene Ontology terms include apoptosis, adhesion, contractility, necrosis, and proliferation. MeSH terms add concepts like Contractility, Adhesion, Necrosis, Proliferation, Apoptosis, and a specific carcinoma type. \n\nSo, I need to model these cellular processes. In CompuCell3D, apoptosis can be handled by setting a target volume and using the apoptosis plugin. Necrosis might require a different approach, perhaps tracking cell volume or other properties. Proliferation would involve cell division, maybe using the mitosis plugin. Adhesion is managed through contact energy in the energy functions. Contractility could relate to cell elasticity or other mechanical properties.\n\nI'll start by importing the necessary modules. Then, define the simulation class. In the __init__ method, I'll initialize the base class. The start method is where I'll define cell types (like MammaryEpithelial and maybe Carcinoma based on the MeSH term) and set their parameters. For each cell type, I'll set attributes like target volume, lambda volume (for volume constraint), adhesion parameters, and maybe flags for apoptosis or necrosis.\n\nIn the step method, I can implement checks during each simulation step. For example, check if a cell's volume is below a certain threshold to trigger necrosis, or use a probability to trigger apoptosis. For proliferation, I might check a cell's condition and then divide it.\n\nWait, but how exactly are apoptosis and necrosis modeled here? Apoptosis in CompuCell usually involves changing the target volume to a smaller value and then removing the cell once it's small enough. For necrosis, maybe a similar approach but with different volume thresholds. Also, contractility might relate to the lambda parameters for volume and surface.\n\nI should define two cell types: normal epithelial and carcinoma. The carcinoma might have different adhesion or proliferation properties. For each, set targetVolume, lambdaVolume, maybe lambdaAdhesion. Then, in the step function, iterate through cells and apply the processes.\n\nFor proliferation, perhaps using the length constraint to determine when a cell divides. Alternatively, set a cell's target volume to increase over time until it splits. But the user mentioned cell proliferation (GO:0008283), so maybe implementing a check in the step method to see if a cell should divide based on some condition, like time or volume.\n\nAlso, contact energies between cell types should be defined to model adhesion. For example, set lower contact energy between cells of the same type to promote adhesion.\n\nPutting this all together, the code would start with imports, then the simulation class. In start(), define cell types, their parameters, and contact energies. In step(), handle apoptosis, necrosis, and proliferation checks.\n\nI need to make sure all the required methods are present: __init__ calls the parent, start initializes cell types, and step runs each timestep. Also, register the steppable with CompuCellSetup.\n\nPotential issues to check: correct inheritance, proper method signatures, and correct usage of CompuCell modules. Also, ensuring that parameters like targetVolume and lambdaVolume are set appropriately for each cell type.\n\nYes, that should cover the main aspects.
