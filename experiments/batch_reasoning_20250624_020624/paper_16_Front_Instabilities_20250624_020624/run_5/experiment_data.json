We study the effects of two parameters on tumor morphology: a diffusion-limitation parameter defined as the ratio of the tumor-substrate consumption rate to the substrate-transport rate, and the tumor-TM surface tension. This initial model omits necrosis and oxidative/hypoxic metabolism effects, which can further influence tumor morphology, but our simplified model still shows significant parameter dependencies. The diffusion-limitation parameter determines whether the growing solid tumor develops a smooth (noninvasive) or fingered (invasive) interface, as in our earlier two-dimensional (2D) simulations. The sensitivity of 3D tumor morphology to tumor-TM surface tension increases with the size of the diffusion-limitation parameter, as in 2D. The 3D results are unexpectedly close to those in 2D. Our results therefore may justify using simpler 2D simulations of tumor growth, instead of more realistic but more computationally expensive 3D simulations. While geometrical artifacts mean that 2D sections of connected 3D tumors may be disconnected, the morphologies of 3D simulated tumors nevertheless correlate with the morphologies of their 2D sections, especially for low-surface-tension tumors, allowing the use of 2D sections to partially reconstruct medically-important 3D-tumor structures."

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants ontology annotations based on the provided tumor simulation study. First, I need to identify relevant terms from Cell Ontology (CL), Gene Ontology (GO), and MeSH.\n\nLooking at the description, it mentions avascular tumors. For CellOntology, avascular tumor cells might be under CL. Maybe \"CL:0000003\" as Tumor Cell? But I need to confirm the exact term. Wait, Cell Ontology has \"CL:0001064\" for neoplastic cell, but the exact term might be \"Tumor Cell\" with the correct ID.\n\nFor GeneOntology, the processes mentioned include tumor growth, cell proliferation, substrate transport, and diffusion. So terms like \"cell proliferation\" (GO:0008283), \"nutrient transport\" (GO:0015872), and \"biological adhesion\" (GO:0022610) for surface tension effects. Also, \"pattern specification\" (GO:0007389) for morphology changes.\n\nMeSH terms could include \"Neoplasms\" (D009369), \"Cell Proliferation\" (D002460), \"Computer Simulation\" (D003198), \"Models, Biological\" (D008954), and \"Diffusion\" (D004066) for the substrate transport.\n\nI need to ensure the IDs are correct without spaces. Check each ontology database. For example, MeSH for Neoplasms is D009369. Cell Ontology's Tumor Cell is CL:0001064. Wait, CL:0001064 is \"neoplastic cell\", which is the correct term. The user specified exact terms, so \"Neoplastic Cell\" is the term. But the original text says \"single-phenotype, avascular tumors\". Maybe \"Avascular Neoplasm\" isn't a CL term. Hmm, maybe CL doesn't have a specific term for avascular tumor cells. Maybe stick with \"Neoplastic Cell\".\n\nFor GO, \"cell division\" is mentioned in the example, but the study talks about tumor growth, which involves cell proliferation. So GO:0008283 (cell proliferation). Substrate transport would be GO:0015872 (monocarboxylic acid transport?) Wait, the study mentions a single limiting nutrient, but not specific. Maybe \"nutrient transport\" (GO:0042718). Wait, GO:0042718 is \"vacuolar transport\", not nutrient. Alternatively, \"transmembrane transport\" (GO:0055085) if it's about substrate transport. Alternatively, \"substrate transport\" isn't a GO term. Maybe \"transport\" in general, but the exact term might be \"nutrient uptake\" (GO:0044715). Hmm. Alternatively, \"substrate consumption\" is part of metabolism. Maybe \"cellular response to nutrient levels\" (GO:0031669). Not sure. Alternatively, \"substrate transport\" could be part of the diffusion process. The study mentions \"substrate-transport rate\", which relates to diffusion. So \"diffusion\" (GO:0046713) is a biological process term? Checking GO:0046713 is \"viral entry into host cell\", no. Wait, maybe \"passive transport\" (GO:0022610)? No, that's \"biological adhesion\". Wait, perhaps \"transmembrane transport\" (GO:0055085) is more appropriate. Alternatively, \"nutrient transport\" (GO:0015872) if the nutrient is a specific type, but the text doesn't specify. Maybe use \"transport\" (GO:0006810) which is the general term. But the user wants exact terms. Let me check. The exact term for \"substrate transport\" might not exist. Maybe the study's \"substrate-transport rate\" refers to the movement of the nutrient, so \"nutrient transport\" (GO:0042718) isn't correct. Alternatively, \"monosaccharide transport\" (GO:0015749) if the nutrient is a sugar, but the text doesn't specify. Alternatively, use \"transmembrane transporter activity\" (GO:0022857) as a molecular function, but the user wants biological process. Hmm. Maybe \"substrate consumption\" is part of metabolic processes. \"Cellular metabolic process\" (GO:0044237). Not sure. Alternatively, since the parameter is about diffusion limitation, perhaps \"diffusion\" (GO:0046713) isn't right. Maybe \"response to nutrient levels\" (GO:0031669). This is tricky. Maybe better to skip that and focus on terms that are clearly present. The study mentions \"tumor growth\", so \"cell proliferation\" (GO:0008283) is solid. Also, \"biological adhesion\" (GO:0022610) for surface tension effects. And \"pattern specification\" (GO:0007389) for morphology changes.\n\nFor MeSH, \"Neoplasms\" (D009369) is correct. \"Cell Proliferation\" (D002460), \"Computer Simulation\" (D003198), \"Models, Biological\" (D008954), \"Diffusion\" (D004066). Also, \"Tumor Microenvironment\" (D059016) might be relevant due to the tissue matrix. But the text mentions \"homogeneous tissue matrix\", so maybe \"Extracellular Matrix\" (D005109). Alternatively, \"Tissue Scaffolds\" (D058727), but not sure. The study focuses on tumor-TM surface tension, so maybe \"Surface Properties\" (D013492). But MeSH terms should be exact. Let me check. \"Surface Tension\" is a MeSH term under D013492 (Surface Properties). So include \"Surface Properties\" (D013492). Alternatively, if \"Surface Tension\" is a separate term, but in MeSH, it's under D013492. So maybe \"Surface Properties\".\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nCellOntology: Neoplastic Cell (CL:0001064)\nGeneOntology: Cell Proliferation (GO:0008283), Biological Adhesion (GO:0022610), Pattern Specification (GO:0007389)\nMeSH: Neoplasms (D009369), Cell Proliferation (D002460), Computer Simulation (D003198), Models, Biological (D008954), Diffusion (D004066), Surface Properties (D013492)\n\nCheck if IDs are correct. CL:0001064 is indeed Neoplastic Cell. GO:0008283 is cell proliferation. GO:0022610 is biological adhesion. GO:0007389 is pattern specification. MeSH D009369 for Neoplasms, D002460 for Cell Proliferation, D003198 for Computer Simulation, D008954 Models, Biological, D004066 Diffusion, D013492 Surface Properties.\n\nI think that's all. Now format as JSON with exact category names and IDs.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0001064\",\n            \"term\": \"Neoplastic Cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0008283\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Proliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0022610\",\n            \"term\": \"Biological Adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007389\",\n            \"term\": \"Pattern Specification\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D009369\",\n            \"term\": \"Neoplasms\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002460\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Proliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D003198\",\n            \"term\": \"Computer Simulation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D008954\",\n            \"term\": \"Models, Biological\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D004066\",\n            \"term\": \"Diffusion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D013492\",\n            \"term\": \"Surface Properties\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```"
