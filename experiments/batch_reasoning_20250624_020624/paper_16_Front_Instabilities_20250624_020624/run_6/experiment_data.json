This initial model omits necrosis and oxidative/hypoxic metabolism effects, which can further influence tumor morphology, but our simplified model still shows significant parameter dependencies. The diffusion-limitation parameter determines whether the growing solid tumor develops a smooth (noninvasive) or fingered (invasive) interface, as in our earlier two-dimensional (2D) simulations. The sensitivity of 3D tumor morphology to tumor-TM surface tension increases with the size of the diffusion-limitation parameter, as in 2D. The 3D results are unexpectedly close to those in 2D. Our results therefore may justify using simpler 2D simulations of tumor growth, instead of more realistic but more computationally expensive 3D simulations. While geometrical artifacts mean that 2D sections of connected 3D tumors may be disconnected, the morphologies of 3D simulated tumors nevertheless correlate with the morphologies of their 2D sections, especially for low-surface-tension tumors, allowing the use of 2D sections to partially reconstruct medically-important 3D-tumor structures."

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a JSON object with ontology annotations based on the provided information. Let's start by understanding the original description. The study uses the Glazier-Graner-Hogeweg model (probably a cellular Potts model) to simulate 3D avascular tumors in a homogeneous tissue matrix. They look at parameters like diffusion-limitation and surface tension affecting tumor morphology.\n\nFirst, for CellOntology. The model is about tumors, which are made of cancer cells. But the description mentions \"single-phenotype\" avascular tumors. In Cell Ontology, there's a term for neoplastic cells. Let me check the CL terms. \"Neoplastic cell\" is CL:0008032. Also, the tumor is growing in a tissue matrix, maybe stromal cells? But the matrix is homogeneous, supplying nutrients. The cells are epithelial or mesenchymal? The terms mentioned in the example are Epithelial and Mesenchymal. Wait, the original text mentions tumor-TM surface tension. TM is tissue matrix. The tumor cells might be epithelial, but the model might not specify. However, the example given uses \"Epithelial\". But the paper doesn't explicitly state the cell type. Hmm, maybe the cells are modeled as epithelial-like? Or perhaps since it's a general tumor model, the Cell Ontology term for neoplastic cell is appropriate. Alternatively, maybe \"tumor cell\" (CL:0001063) is a term. Let me verify. CL:0001063 is \"abnormal cell\", which is a parent of neoplastic cell. Maybe CL:0008032 is better. I'll go with neoplastic cell. Wait, but the example uses \"Epithelial\". The original description doesn't specify the cell type. Maybe the model uses epithelial cells? The clarification didn't add anything. Wait, the original text doesn't mention epithelial or mesenchymal cells. The example given in the problem had \"Epithelial\", but that's just an example. So perhaps there's no specific CellOntology term here unless the model is about epithelial tumors. Since the user hasn't specified, maybe there's no applicable CellOntology term. Wait, but the example uses \"Epithelial\". Maybe the answer should include \"Neoplastic Cell\" if applicable. Alternatively, maybe not. Let me check if there's a CL term for tumor cells. CL:0001063 is \"abnormal cell\", but CL:0008032 is \"neoplastic cell\". Since the study is about tumor growth, \"neoplastic cell\" is appropriate. So CellOntology would have CL:0008032, term \"neoplastic cell\".\n\nNext, GeneOntology. The model involves processes like cell proliferation, growth, response to nutrient levels. The parameters studied are diffusion-limitation (nutrient transport) and surface tension (cell adhesion). So relevant GO terms might include \"cell-substrate adhesion\" (GO:0031589), \"nutrient transport\" (GO:0006810), \"cell proliferation\" (GO:0008283), \"tumor growth\" (GO:0001558), \"morphogenesis of a branching structure\" (GO:0001763) if branching is involved. The study mentions tumor morphology changes, like smooth vs fingered interfaces, which could relate to cell adhesion (GO:0007155) or morphogenesis (GO:0009653). Let me check the exact terms. \"Cell-substrate adhesion\" is GO:0031589. \"Cell proliferation\" is GO:0008283. \"Substrate transport\" might be \"transport\" (GO:0006810), but the parameter is about the ratio of consumption to transport rate. Maybe \"response to nutrient levels\" (GO:0031667). Also, \"tumor growth\" is GO:0001558. \"Pattern specification involved in morphological boundary formation\" (GO:0060793) might be relevant for the interface morphology. But I need to pick the most exact terms. The study's focus is on tumor growth influenced by diffusion and surface tension, so \"cell proliferation\" (GO:0008283), \"cell-substrate adhesion\" (GO:0031589), \"nutrient transport\" (GO:0006810), and perhaps \"tumor growth\" (GO:0001558).\n\nFor MeSH terms, the study is about tumor growth, 3D cell culture models, computer simulation, maybe neoplasms (MeSH D009369). Other terms: \"Models, Biological\" (D008954), \"Cell Proliferation\" (D049109), \"Neoplasms\" (D009369), \"Computer Simulation\" (D003198), \"Cell Adhesion\" (D002448). The study uses computational models, so \"Computer Simulation\" (D003198). \"Tumor Microenvironment\" (D059016) might be relevant since it's about the tissue matrix. Also, \"Cell Movement\" (D002465) if invasion is considered. The study mentions invasive vs noninvasive interfaces. So MeSH terms could include \"Neoplasms\" (D009369), \"Computer Simulation\" (D003198), \"Cell Proliferation\" (D049109), \"Cell Adhesion\" (D002448), \"Tumor Microenvironment\" (D059016), and maybe \"Cell Movement\" (D002465) for invasion.\n\nNow, need to format all correctly. Ensure IDs are exact, no spaces. Check term names for exactness. Let me compile each section.\n\nCellOntology: The cell type is neoplastic cells, so CL:0008032, term \"neoplastic cell\".\n\nGeneOntology: Terms related to the processes involved. \"cell proliferation\" (GO:0008283), \"cell-substrate adhesion\" (GO:0031589), \"nutrient transport\" (GO:0006810), \"tumor growth\" (GO:0001558).\n\nMeSH: \"Neoplasms\" (D009369), \"Computer Simulation\" (D003198), \"Cell Proliferation\" (D049109), \"Cell Adhesion\" (D002448), \"Tumor Microenvironment\" (D059016).\n\nDouble-check term names and IDs. For example, \"cell-substrate adhesion\" vs \"cell adhesion\". The GO term for cell-substrate adhesion is correct as GO:0031589. \"Nutrient transport\" is GO:0006810 (which is the general transport term, but maybe \"monocarboxylic acid transport\" if the nutrient is glucose, but the text mentions a single limiting nutrient without specifying. Maybe better to use \"transport\" but the exact term might be \"substrate transport\". Alternatively, check if \"nutrient transport\" exists as a GO term. GO:0015798 is \"glycerol transport\", GO:0015800 is \"acidic amino acid transport\". Maybe the general term \"transmembrane transport\" (GO:0055085). Alternatively, since the parameter is about consumption vs transport rate, perhaps \"substrate consumption\" (GO:0016042 - cellular carbohydrate metabolic process?), but not sure. Alternatively, \"response to nutrient levels\" (GO:0031667). Hmm. The original text says \"limiting nutrient\" supplied by the tissue matrix. The key processes are nutrient transport (diffusion) and consumption. So \"nutrient transport\" might be the best fit, but I need to verify if that's a GO term. Searching GO, \"nutrient transport\" is a child of \"transport\" (GO:0006810), but the exact term \"nutrient transport\" is GO:0044765. Let me confirm. GO:0044765 is \"single-organism transport\", which is a broader term. Wait, maybe \"transmembrane transport\" (GO:0055085) or \"substrate-specific transmembrane transporter activity\" (GO:0022891). Alternatively, the parameter is about the ratio of consumption to transport rate, which might relate to \"substrate consumption\" and \"substrate transport\". However, if there's a GO term for \"substrate consumption\", perhaps \"catabolic process\" (GO:0009056). Alternatively, maybe \"cellular response to nutrient levels\" (GO:0031669). This is getting a bit ambiguous. Since the user wants exact term names, perhaps stick with \"nutrient transport\" if that's a valid term. Checking QuickGO, \"nutrient transport\" is not a primary term. The closest might be \"carbohydrate transport\" (GO:0008643) if the nutrient is glucose. But the text doesn't specify. Alternatively, use \"transport\" (GO:0006810) with term \"transport\". Alternatively, \"substrate transport\" isn't a standard term. Maybe better to use \"response to nutrient\" (GO:0007584) but that's \"response to nutrient\". Alternatively, since the model involves diffusion, \"passive transmembrane transporter activity\" (GO:0022807). Hmm, maybe it's safer to include \"nutrient transport\" as a term, but if it's not a valid GO term, this would be incorrect. Wait, checking the GO term database, \"nutrient transport\" is actually a synonym for \"vitamin transport\" (GO:0051182), which is not appropriate. So maybe \"transport\" (GO:0006810) is the best fit here. So for the parameter involving substrate transport rate, use \"transport\" with GO:0006810. Alternatively, \"substrate transport\" is not a standard term. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to use \"transport\" (GO:0006810) with term \"transport\". Similarly, consumption rate relates to \"catabolic process\" ("
