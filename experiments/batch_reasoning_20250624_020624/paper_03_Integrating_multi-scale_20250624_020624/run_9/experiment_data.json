      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants structured ontology annotations based on the provided biological description. They specified Cell Ontology, Gene Ontology, and MeSH terms.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original description. The main topics are heart development, specifically trabeculation involving endocardial and myocardial cells. There's mention of molecular pathways, cell-cell interactions, tissue-specific behavior, and a Cellular Potts model for simulation.\n\nFor CellOntology, the relevant cell types are endocardial and myocardial cells. Checking Cell Ontology IDs: Endocardial cells are CL:0002250, Myocardial cells are CL:0000746. Got those.\n\nGeneOntology terms should relate to the biological processes mentioned. Trabeculation is part of heart morphogenesis (GO:0003007). Cell-cell interaction is part of cell-cell adhesion (GO:0098609). Tissue-specific cell behavior might fall under cell migration (GO:0016477). The systems biology approach could relate to computational models (GO:0035635). Also, heart development itself (GO:0007507).\n\nMeSH terms: Heart development is D006357. Systems biology is D053683. Computational biology is D019295. Cell adhesion is D015815. Cell proliferation is D049711.\n\nNeed to ensure all IDs and terms are exact without extra spaces. Check each term's official name. For example, \"Cell-Cell Adhesion\" vs. \"Cell-cell adhesion\"\u2014MeSH uses \"Cell Adhesion\" as a term. Similarly, Gene Ontology uses \"cell-cell adhesion\" but the term in the example was \"Cell Division\" with capitalization, so probably title case. Wait, the example had \"Cell Division\" as a term. Looking up GO:0098609, the term is \"cell-cell adhesion\" but maybe the user expects title case. Wait, the user's example term was \"Cell Division\", which is the correct term in GO. However, in reality, GO terms are in lowercase. But the example given by the user uses title case. So need to follow the example's formatting even if it's not technically correct. Hmm, the user's example shows \"Cell Division\" with title case, but actual GO terms are in lowercase. This is conflicting. Wait, the user's instructions say: \"Term names must be exact without extra spaces\". So I need to use the exact term as per the ontology. Let me verify.\n\nChecking GO:0003007 is \"heart morphogenesis\". GO:0098609 is \"cell-cell adhesion\". GO:0016477 is \"cell migration\". GO:0035635 is \"maintenance of protein location in cell body\", which doesn't fit. Wait, the user mentioned \"computational simulation\", so maybe \"computational modeling\"? Looking for GO terms related to computational models. Hmm, maybe \"computational modeling\" isn't a GO term. Alternatively, \"mathematical modeling in biological process\" (GO:0065002) but that's a parent term. Maybe the user intended GO:0035635 isn't correct. Wait, perhaps \"model organism\" terms, but not exactly. Maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Alternatively, maybe they meant GO:0003012 (muscle system process) but that's a stretch. Alternatively, perhaps the systems biology approach here relates to \"systems biology\" itself, but MeSH has that. For GO, maybe focus on the biological processes mentioned: heart development, cell migration, adhesion, etc.\n\nSo maybe exclude the systems biology part from GeneOntology and focus on the biological processes. Let me confirm: the original text mentions \"systems biology approach\" but that's more of a methodology. So perhaps for GeneOntology, stick to the processes like heart morphogenesis, cell adhesion, cell migration, heart development. \n\nMeSH terms: D006357 for Heart Development, D049711 for Cell Proliferation (though the text mentions cell behavior, but maybe proliferation is a part of that). Also, \"Cell-Cell Interaction\" might map to D015815 (Cell Adhesion). The Cellular Potts model is a computational model, so D019295 (Computational Biology) applies. Systems biology is D053683. \n\nSo compiling all:\n\nCellOntology:\n- CL:0002250 (endocardial cell)\n- CL:0000746 (myocardial cell)\n\nGeneOntology:\n- GO:0003007 (heart morphogenesis)\n- GO:0098609 (cell-cell adhesion)\n- GO:0016477 (cell migration)\n- GO:0007507 (heart development)\n\nMeSH:\n- D006357 (Heart Development)\n- D053683 (Systems Biology)\n- D019295 (Computational Biology)\n- D015815 (Cell Adhesion)\n\nWait, the original text mentions trabeculation, which is part of heart morphogenesis, so that's covered. The Cell-Cell interactions are part of adhesion. Tissue-specific cell behavior includes migration. The systems biology and computational modeling are covered in MeSH. Also, the example had \"Cell Proliferation\" as MeSH, but the original text mentions cell proliferation? Let me check the original text. The text says \"tissue-speci\ufb01c cell behavior\" and \"cell\u2013cell interactions\". The MeSH term for Cell Proliferation is D049711. But the text doesn't explicitly mention proliferation, but maybe it's part of trabeculation. Alternatively, maybe include it if it's implied. Hmm. The text says \"cell behavior\" which can include proliferation, migration, etc. Since the example included \"Cell Proliferation\", maybe the user expects that. But if the original text doesn't mention proliferation explicitly, maybe it's safer not to include. Alternatively, since trabeculation involves growth, maybe proliferation is relevant. But the original text doesn't explicitly say \"proliferation\". So maybe better to avoid unless certain.\n\nAlternatively, the text mentions \"cell behavior\" and \"contributes to factors\", so perhaps proliferation is part of that. Maybe include it. So MeSH would have D049711 (Cell Proliferation) as well. But need to check if the original text mentions proliferation. The text says \"cell proliferation\" is part of the molecular pathways? Let me check: The text says \"molecular pathways underlying cell\u2013cell interactions and tissue-speci\ufb01c cell behavior\". So \"cell behavior\" could include proliferation, but it's not explicit. Since the example included \"Cell Proliferation\", maybe the user wants that. Alternatively, perhaps the original text's \"cell behavior\" is too vague. But given that trabeculation involves growth, maybe including Cell Proliferation is acceptable.\n\nSo, MeSH terms would be Heart Development (D006357), Systems Biology (D053683), Computational Biology (D019295), Cell Adhesion (D015815), and Cell Proliferation (D049711).\n\nNow, checking the exact term names. For example, MeSH's term for D015815 is \"Cell Adhesion\" (exact). D049711 is \"Cell Proliferation\". Correct.\n\nSo the final JSON should have these entries, formatted exactly as specified.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0002250\",\n            \"term\": \"endocardial cell\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000746\",\n            \"term\": \"myocardial cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0003007\",\n            \"term\": \"heart morphogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0098609\",\n            \"term\": \"cell-cell adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0016477\",\n            \"term\": \"cell migration\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007507\",\n            \"term\": \"heart development\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D006357\",\n            \"term\": \"Heart Development\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D053683\",\n            \"term\": \"Systems Biology\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D019295\",\n            \"term\": \"Computational Biology\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D015815\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D049711\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Proliferation\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"

Basic cell types and parameters based on the ontology annotations",
      "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation Python file based on the given ontology annotations. Let me start by recalling the structure of a typical CompuCell3D script. The user specified that the code must include required imports, a simulation class inheriting from SteppableBasePy, and the __init__, start, and step methods. Also, basic cell types and parameters based on the provided ontology terms.\n\nFirst, the imports. CompuCellSetup is always needed, and steppables from the cc3d.core.PySteppables module. So I'll start with importing those.\n\nNext, the simulation class. It should inherit from steppables.SteppableBasePy. The class will have an __init__ method where I call the parent's __init__, the start method for initial setup, and the step method for actions each simulation step.\n\nLooking at the ontology annotations: Cell types are endocardial and myocardial cells. The Gene Ontology terms include heart morphogenesis, cell adhesion, migration, and development. MeSH terms mention cell proliferation, adhesion, etc. So the simulation should model these cell types with properties related to adhesion, migration, and possibly proliferation.\n\nIn the start method, I need to set up the cell types. Using self.cellTypeDict, assigning type names and their corresponding IDs. Also, set up the contact energy between cell types. For cell-cell adhesion (GO:0098609), contact energies are important. Typically, lower energy means cells stick together more. So maybe set lower energy between the same type and higher between different types. For example, endocardial-endocardial and myocardial-myocardial have lower contact energy, while endocardial-myocardial have higher.\n\nAlso, considering cell migration (GO:0016477), I might need to set up a chemotaxis plugin. But the user didn't mention adding chemotaxis, so maybe that's optional. Alternatively, adjust lambda parameters for volume and adhesion in the constraints. For cell movement, the adhesion parameters affect how cells move and separate.\n\nFor cell proliferation (MeSH:D049711), perhaps include a parameter in the step method to check cell volume and divide if a condition is met. But the user's example doesn't include proliferation code, maybe they just want the setup. Wait, the step method is required. In the example, maybe in step, I can check cell volume and trigger division. But in the provided answer, maybe a placeholder comment for proliferation.\n\nIn the start method, after setting cell types and contact energies, initialize some cells. Maybe create a cell field with a blob of each type. Using self.cell_field to access the field and create cells at certain positions.\n\nThe simulation parameters: dim_x, dim_y, dim_z, steps. Maybe set the dimensions to 100x100x1 for a 2D simulation. Steps could be 1000.\n\nFor the cell properties, each cell type should have a target volume and lambda volume. Also, lambda adhesion for cell-cell adhesion strength. So in the start method, when creating cells, assign these attributes.\n\nPutting it all together: imports, the simulation class with __init__, start, step. In start, define cell types, contact energies, create cells. In step, maybe check for cell division based on volume. But the example might not have actual division code, just a comment.\n\nWait, the user asked for basic parameters based on ontology. So in the code, the cell types are defined, contact energies, volume parameters. The step method could have a loop over cells, check if their volume is above a threshold, and then divide. But how to implement that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe just set up the necessary plugins: VolumePlugin, ContactPlugin, maybe Chemotaxis if needed. But the minimal code would include Volume and Contact. So in the XML, those plugins are required, but in the Python script, maybe just the parameters.\n\nWait, the code doesn't generate the XML, it's a Python simulation file. So in the Python code, the user has to set up the parameters via the steppable.\n\nSo, in the start method, after creating cells, assign targetVolume, lambdaVolume, and targetSurface and lambdaSurface if using the surface constraint. Also, contact energies.\n\nThe step method could iterate through each cell and, for example, increase target volume over time to simulate growth, but maybe just a placeholder. The user might just need the structure with the step method implemented, even if it's empty except for a pass.\n\nBut the problem states to include required methods: __init__, start, step. So step can't be empty. Maybe in step, have a condition where if a cell's volume is over a threshold, it divides. But how to do that in CompuCell3D? Using the cell division module.\n\nAlternatively, use the step method to randomly divide cells. But perhaps in the example, just a loop over cells and check for volume, then call divide.\n\nBut I need to make sure the code is correct. Let me outline:\n\nImports:\n\nfrom cc3d.core.PySteppables import *\n\nClass SimulationSteppable(SteppableBasePy):\n\n    def __init__(self, frequency=1):\n        super().__init__(frequency)\n\n    def start(self):\n        # Set up cell types\n        self.cellTypeDict = {\n            \"Endocardial\": self.register_new_cell_type(\"Endocardial\"),\n            \"Myocardial\": self.register_new_cell_type(\"Myocardial\"),\n        }\n        # Contact energies\n        self.contact_energy_table.table = [\n            [10, 16],\n            [16, 10]\n        ]\n        # Create cells\n        for i in range(20):\n            cell = self.new_cell(self.cellTypeDict[\"Endocardial\"])\n            self.cell_field[5 + i, 50, 0] = cell\n            cell.targetVolume = 25\n            cell.lambdaVolume = 2.0\n\n        for i in range(20):\n            cell = self.new_cell(self.cellTypeDict[\"Myocardial\"])\n            self.cell_field[75 + i, 50, 0] = cell\n            cell.targetVolume = 25\n            cell.lambdaVolume = 2.0\n\n    def step(self, mcs):\n        for cell in self.cell_list:\n            if cell.volume > 30:\n                cell.targetVolume += 5  # Simulate growth\n                # Alternatively, divide:\n                # cell.divide()\n            # Maybe check for conditions related to migration or adhesion\n\nBut in the provided answer, maybe a more minimal example. Also, in CompuCell3D, the contact energy is set via the contact plugin. So in the start method, you set the contact energy between cell types. The code would need to access the contact energy table and set the values.\n\nWait, in the code example, the contact_energy_table is part of the steppable. So using self.contact_energy_table.table to set the matrix. The order of the cell types as registered determines the indices. So Endocardial is 0, Myocardial is 1. Then the contact energy between Endocardial and Endocardial is 10, between Endocardial and Myocardial is 16, etc.\n\nPutting all together, the code would have the imports, the class with __init__, start, step. The start method sets up cell types, contact energies, initializes cells. The step method can have a loop over cells, perhaps modifying properties. For proliferation, in step, if a cell's volume is over a threshold, call cell.divide(). But maybe the example just includes a placeholder comment.\n\nSo the final code would look like:\n\nfrom cc3d.core.PySteppables import *\n\nclass SimulationSteppable(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, frequency=1):\n        super().__init__(frequency)\n\n    def start(self):\n        self.cellTypeDict = {\n            \"Endocardial\": self.register_new_cell_type(\"Endocardial\"),\n            \"Myocardial\": self.register_new_cell_type(\"Myocardial\")\n        }\n        self.contact_energy_table.table = [\n            [10, 16],\n            [16, 10]\n        ]\n        for i in range(20):\n            cell = self.new_cell(self.cellTypeDict[\"Endocardial\"])\n            self.cell_field[5+i, 50, 0] = cell\n            cell.targetVolume = 25\n            cell.lambdaVolume = 2.0\n\n        for i in range(20):\n            cell = self.new_cell(self.cellTypeDict[\"Myocardial\"])\n            self.cell_field[75+i, 50, 0] = cell\n            cell.targetVolume = 25\n            cell.lambdaVolume = 2.0\n\n    def step(self, mcs):\n        for cell in self.cell_list:\n            if cell.volume > 30:\n                cell.targetVolume = 25\n                cell.divide()\n\nBut I need to check if cell division is properly handled. Also, when creating cells, the example uses self.new_cell and assigns to the cell_field. The step method loops through all cells and checks volume, then divides if needed. This should trigger cell division.\n\nBut the user didn't specify details on proliferation, just that it's part of the MeSH terms. So including a basic proliferation mechanism makes sense.\n\nAnother thing: the simulation setup requires specifying the XML. But the user wants a Python script. However, CompuCell3D requires an XML for simulation configuration. Wait, no\u2014 in newer versions, you can set up the simulation entirely via Python. So"

Looking up GO:0098609, the term is \"cell-cell adhesion\" but maybe the user expects title case. Wait, the user's example term was \"Cell Division\", which is the correct term in GO. However, in reality, GO terms are in lowercase. But the example given by the user uses title case. So need to follow the example's formatting even if it's not technically correct. Hmm, the user's example shows \"Cell Division\" with title case, but actual GO terms are in lowercase. This is conflicting. Wait, the user's instructions say: \"Term names must be exact without extra spaces\". So I need to use the exact term as per the ontology. Let me verify.\n\nChecking GO:0003007 is \"heart morphogenesis\". GO:0098609 is \"cell-cell adhesion\". GO:0016477 is \"cell migration\". GO:0035635 is \"maintenance of protein location in cell body\", which doesn't fit. Wait, the user mentioned \"computational simulation\", so maybe \"computational modeling\"? Looking for GO terms related to computational models. Hmm, maybe \"computational modeling\" isn't a GO term. Alternatively, \"mathematical modeling in biological process\" (GO:0065002) but that's a parent term. Maybe the user intended GO:0035635 isn't correct. Wait, perhaps \"model organism\" terms, but not exactly. Maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Alternatively, maybe they meant GO:0003012 (muscle system process) but that's a stretch. Alternatively, perhaps the systems biology approach here relates to \"systems biology\" itself, but MeSH has that. For GO, maybe focus on the biological processes mentioned: heart development, cell migration, adhesion, etc.\n\nSo maybe exclude the systems biology part from GeneOntology and focus on the biological processes. Let me confirm: the original text mentions \"systems biology approach\" but that's more of a methodology. So perhaps for GeneOntology, stick to the processes like heart morphogenesis, cell adhesion, cell migration, heart development. \n\nMeSH terms: D006357 for Heart Development, D049711 for Cell Proliferation (though the text mentions cell behavior, but maybe proliferation is a part of that). Also, \"Cell-Cell Interaction\" might map to D015815 (Cell Adhesion). The Cellular Potts model is a computational model, so D019295 (Computational Biology) applies. Systems biology is D053683. \n\nSo compiling all:\n\nCellOntology:\n- CL:0002250 (endocardial cell)\n- CL:0000746 (myocardial cell)\n\nGeneOntology:\n- GO:0003007 (heart morphogenesis)\n- GO:0098609 (cell-cell adhesion)\n- GO:0016477 (cell migration)\n- GO:0007507 (heart development)\n\nMeSH:\n- D006357 (Heart Development)\n- D053683 (Systems Biology)\n- D019295 (Computational Biology)\n- D015815 (Cell Adhesion)\n\nWait, the original text mentions trabeculation, which is part of heart morphogenesis, so that's covered. The Cell-Cell interactions are part of adhesion. Tissue-specific cell behavior includes migration. The systems biology and computational modeling are covered in MeSH. Also, the example had \"Cell Proliferation\" as MeSH, but the original text mentions cell proliferation? Let me check the original text. The text says \"tissue-speci\ufb01c cell behavior\" and \"cell\u2013cell interactions\". The MeSH term for Cell Proliferation is D049711. But the text doesn't explicitly mention proliferation, but maybe it's part of trabeculation. Alternatively, maybe include it if it's implied. Hmm. The text says \"cell behavior\" which can include proliferation, migration, etc. Since the example included \"Cell Proliferation\", maybe the user expects that. But if the original text doesn't mention proliferation explicitly, maybe it's safer not to include. Alternatively, since trabeculation involves growth, maybe proliferation is relevant. But the original text doesn't explicitly say \"proliferation\". So maybe better to avoid unless certain.\n\nAlternatively, the text mentions \"cell behavior\" and \"contributes to factors\", so perhaps proliferation is part of that. Maybe include it. So MeSH would have D049711 (Cell Proliferation) as well. But need to check if the original text mentions proliferation. The text says \"cell proliferation\" is part of the molecular pathways? Let me check: The text says \"molecular pathways underlying cell\u2013cell interactions and tissue-speci\ufb01c cell behavior\". So \"cell behavior\" could include proliferation, but it's not explicit. Since the example included \"Cell Proliferation\", maybe the user wants that. Alternatively, perhaps the original text's \"cell behavior\" is too vague. But given that trabeculation involves growth, maybe including Cell Proliferation is acceptable.\n\nSo, MeSH terms would be Heart Development (D006357), Systems Biology (D053683), Computational Biology (D019295), Cell Adhesion (D015815), and Cell Proliferation (D049711).\n\nNow, checking the exact term names. For example, MeSH's term for D015815 is \"Cell Adhesion\" (exact). D049711 is \"Cell Proliferation\". Correct.\n\nSo the final JSON should have these entries, formatted exactly as specified.\n</think>",
    "cc3d_file_creation": {
      "python_code": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation Python file based on the given ontology annotations. Let me start by recalling the structure of a typical CompuCell3D script. The user specified that the code must include required imports, a simulation class inheriting from SteppableBasePy, and the __init__, start, and step methods. Also, basic cell types and parameters based on the provided ontology terms.\n\nFirst, the imports. CompuCellSetup is always needed, and steppables from the cc3d.core.PySteppables module. So I'll start with importing those.\n\nNext, the simulation class. It should inherit from steppables.SteppableBasePy. The class will have an __init__ method where I call the parent's __init__, the start method for initial setup, and the step method for actions each simulation step.\n\nLooking at the ontology annotations: Cell types are endocardial and myocardial cells. The Gene Ontology terms include heart morphogenesis, cell adhesion, migration, and development. MeSH terms mention cell proliferation, adhesion, etc. So the simulation should model these cell types with properties related to adhesion, migration, and possibly proliferation.\n\nIn the start method, I need to set up the cell types. Using self.cellTypeDict, assigning type names and their corresponding IDs. Also, set up the contact energy between cell types. For cell-cell adhesion (GO:0098609), contact energies are important. Typically, lower energy means cells stick together more. So maybe set lower energy between the same type and higher between different types. For example, endocardial-endocardial and myocardial-myocardial have lower contact energy, while endocardial-myocardial have higher.\n\nAlso, considering cell migration (GO:0016477), I might need to set up a chemotaxis plugin. But the user didn't mention adding chemotaxis, so maybe that's optional. Alternatively, adjust lambda parameters for volume and adhesion in the constraints. For cell movement, the adhesion parameters affect how cells move and separate.\n\nFor cell proliferation (MeSH:D049711), perhaps include a parameter in the step method to check cell volume and divide if a condition is met. But the user's example doesn't include proliferation code, maybe they just want the setup. Wait, the step method is required. In the example, maybe in step, I can check cell volume and trigger division. But in the provided answer, maybe a placeholder comment for proliferation.\n\nIn the start method, after setting cell types and contact energies, initialize some cells. Maybe create a cell field with a blob of each type. Using self.cell_field to access the field and create cells at certain positions.\n\nThe simulation parameters: dim_x, dim_y, dim_z, steps. Maybe set the dimensions to 100x100x1 for a 2D simulation. Steps could be 1000.\n\nFor the cell properties, each cell type should have a target volume and lambda volume. Also, lambda adhesion for cell-cell adhesion strength. So in the start method, when creating cells, assign these attributes.\n\nPutting it all together: imports, the simulation class with __init__, start, step. In start, define cell types, contact energies, create cells. In step, maybe check for cell division based on volume. But the example might not have actual division code, just a comment.\n\nWait, the user asked for basic parameters based on ontology. So in the code, the cell types are defined, contact energies, volume parameters. The step method could have a loop over cells, check if their volume is above a threshold, and then divide. But how to implement that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe just set up the necessary plugins: VolumePlugin, ContactPlugin, maybe Chemotaxis if needed. But the minimal code would include Volume and Contact. So in the XML, those plugins are required, but in the Python script, maybe just the parameters.\n\nWait, the code doesn't generate the XML, it's a Python simulation file. So in the Python code, the user has to set up the parameters via the steppable.\n\nSo, in the start method, after creating cells, assign targetVolume, lambdaVolume, and targetSurface and lambdaSurface if using the surface constraint. Also, contact energies.\n\nThe step method could iterate through each cell and, for example, increase target volume over time to simulate growth, but maybe just a placeholder. The user might just need the structure with the step method implemented, even if it's empty except for a pass.\n\nBut the problem states to include required methods: __init__, start, step. So step can't be empty. Maybe in step, have a condition where if a cell's volume is over a threshold, it divides. But how to do that in CompuCell3D? Using the cell division module.\n\nAlternatively, use the step method to randomly divide cells. But perhaps in the example, just a loop over cells and check for volume, then call divide.\n\nBut I need to make sure the code is correct. Let me outline:\n\nImports:\n\nfrom cc3d.core.PySteppables import *\n\nClass SimulationSteppable(SteppableBasePy):\n\n    def __init__(self, frequency=1):\n        super().__init__(frequency)\n\n    def start(self):\n        # Set up cell types\n        self.cellTypeDict = {\n            \"Endocardial\": self.register_new_cell_type(\"Endocardial\"),\n            \"Myocardial\": self.register_new_cell_type(\"Myocardial\"),\n        }\n        # Contact energies\n        self.contact_energy_table.table = [\n            [10, 16],\n            [16, 10]\n        ]\n        # Create cells\n        for i in range(20):\n            cell = self.new_cell(self.cellTypeDict[\"Endocardial\"])\n            self.cell_field[5 + i, 50, 0] = cell\n            cell.targetVolume = 25\n            cell.lambdaVolume = 2.0\n\n        for i in range(20):\n            cell = self.new_cell(self.cellTypeDict[\"Myocardial\"])\n            self.cell_field[75 + i, 50, 0] = cell\n            cell.targetVolume = 25\n            cell.lambdaVolume = 2.0\n\n    def step(self, mcs):\n        for cell in self.cell_list:\n            if cell.volume > 30:\n                cell.targetVolume += 5  # Simulate growth\n                # Alternatively, divide:\n                # cell.divide()\n            # Maybe check for conditions related to migration or adhesion\n\nBut in the provided answer, maybe a more minimal example. Also, in CompuCell3D, the contact energy is set via the contact plugin. So in the start method, you set the contact energy between cell types. The code would need to access the contact energy table and set the values.\n\nWait, in the code example, the contact_energy_table is part of the steppable. So using self.contact_energy_table.table to set the matrix. The order of the cell types as registered determines the indices. So Endocardial is 0, Myocardial is 1. Then the contact energy between Endocardial and Endocardial is 10, between Endocardial and Myocardial is 16, etc.\n\nPutting all together, the code would have the imports, the class with __init__, start, step. The start method sets up cell types, contact energies, initializes cells. The step method can have a loop over cells, perhaps modifying properties. For proliferation, in step, if a cell's volume is over a threshold, call cell.divide(). But maybe the example just includes a placeholder comment.\n\nSo the final code would look like:\n\nfrom cc3d.core.PySteppables import *\n\nclass SimulationSteppable(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, frequency=1):\n        super().__init__(frequency)\n\n    def start(self):\n        self.cellTypeDict = {\n            \"Endocardial\": self.register_new_cell_type(\"Endocardial\"),\n            \"Myocardial\": self.register_new_cell_type(\"Myocardial\")\n        }\n        self.contact_energy_table.table = [\n            [10, 16],\n            [16, 10]\n        ]\n        for i in range(20):\n            cell = self.new_cell(self.cellTypeDict[\"Endocardial\"])\n            self.cell_field[5+i, 50, 0] = cell\n            cell.targetVolume = 25\n            cell.lambdaVolume = 2.0\n\n        for i in range(20):\n            cell = self.new_cell(self.cellTypeDict[\"Myocardial\"])\n            self.cell_field[75+i, 50, 0] = cell\n            cell.targetVolume = 25\n            cell.lambdaVolume = 2.0\n\n    def step(self, mcs):\n        for cell in self.cell_list:\n            if cell.volume > 30:\n                cell.targetVolume = 25\n                cell.divide()\n\nBut I need to check if cell division is properly handled. Also, when creating cells, the example uses self.new_cell and assigns to the cell_field. The step method loops through all cells and checks volume, then divides if needed. This should trigger cell division.\n\nBut the user didn't specify details on proliferation, just that it's part of the MeSH terms. So including a basic proliferation mechanism makes sense.\n\nAnother thing: the simulation setup requires specifying the XML. But the user wants a Python script. However, CompuCell3D requires an XML for simulation configuration. Wait, no\u2014 in newer versions, you can set up the simulation entirely via Python. So",
