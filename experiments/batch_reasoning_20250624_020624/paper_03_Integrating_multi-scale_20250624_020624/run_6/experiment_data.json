      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to tackle this. The user wants ontology annotations based on the provided text, using Cell Ontology, Gene Ontology, and MeSH terms. I need to structure the JSON exactly as specified.\n\nFirst, I'll look for cell types mentioned. The text talks about endocardial and myocardial cells. So for CellOntology, I should find their IDs. Checking Cell Ontology, \"endocardial cell\" is CL:0002250, and \"myocardial cell\" is CL:0000746. Got those.\n\nNext, Gene Ontology. The processes mentioned include cell-cell interactions, which might be GO:0007156 (cell-cell adhesion), and heart development, which is GO:0060914. Trabeculation is part of heart development, so maybe GO:0060914. Also, cell proliferation is mentioned, which is GO:0008283. But wait, the example used \"Cell Division\" but here it's proliferation. Need to confirm the exact term. Yes, GO:0008283 is \"cell proliferation\". Also, molecular pathways involved in tissue-specific cell behavior might relate to cell differentiation, so GO:0030154 (cell differentiation). \n\nFor MeSH terms, the topics are systems biology (D053684), heart development (D006331), and computational biology (D019285). The text mentions mathematical models and computational algorithms, so computational biology fits. Trabeculation might be under heart development. \n\nWait, let me check MeSH terms again. Heart Development is D006331. Systems Biology is D053684. Computational Biology is D019285. Yes, those are correct. \n\nNow, make sure the formatting is exact. No extra spaces in terms or IDs. Categories named exactly as specified: CellOntology, GeneOntology, MeSH. \n\nDouble-check the IDs. CL:0002250 for endocardial, CL:0000746 for myocardial. GO terms: 0007156 (cell-cell adhesion), 0060914 (heart morphogenesis), 0008283 (cell proliferation), 0030154 (cell differentiation). MeSH D053684, D006331, D019285. \n\nTerms spelled correctly: \"Endocardial Cell\", \"Myocardial Cell\", \"Cell-Cell Adhesion\", \"Heart Morphogenesis\", \"Cell Proliferation\", \"Cell Differentiation\", \"Systems Biology\", \"Heart Development\", \"Computational Biology\". Wait, in MeSH, \"Heart Development\" is correct, but sometimes it's \"Heart/growth & development\". But the user said to use exact term names. Let me verify. MeSH term D006331 is \"Heart\" with the annotation for development, but the exact term might be \"Heart Development\". Similarly, \"Systems Biology\" and \"Computational Biology\" are correct as MeSH terms.\n\nOkay, that should cover all the required categories. Now structure the JSON without any explanations. Ensure no trailing commas and correct syntax. Check example format again. Alright, I think that's it.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0002250\",\n            \"term\": \"Endocardial Cell\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000746\",\n            \"term\": \"Myocardial Cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007156\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell-Cell Adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0060914\",\n            \"term\": \"Heart Morphogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0008283\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Proliferation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0030154\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Differentiation\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D053684\",\n            \"term\": \"Systems Biology\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D006331\",\n            \"term\": \"Heart Development\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D019285\",\n            \"term\": \"Computational Biology\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"
