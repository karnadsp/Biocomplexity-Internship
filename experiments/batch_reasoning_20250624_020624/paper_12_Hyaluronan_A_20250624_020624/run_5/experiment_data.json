        "description": "During embryonic development, cardiac valves arise at specific regions in the cardiac endothelium that swell up due to enhanced extracellular matrix production (so-called endocardial cushions). An important extracellular matrix component that is produced by the endocardial cells is the glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan. A deficiency in hyaluronan synthesis results in a failure to form endocardial cushions and a loss of their cellularization by a process called endothelial-to-mesenchymal transformation. Expression of the major hyaluronan synthase Has2 is under the influence of both positive and negative regulators. MicroRNA-dependent degradation of Has2 is required to control extracellular hyaluronan levels and thereby the size of the endocardial cushions. In this article, we review the current literature on hyaluronan synthesis during cardiac valve formation and propose that a balanced activity of both positive and negative regulators is required to maintain the critical homeostasis of hyaluronan levels in the extracellular matrix and thereby the size of the endocardial cushions. The activating and inhibitory interactions between microRNA-23, Has2, and hyaluronan are reminiscent of a reaction\u2013diffusion system. Using a mathematical modeling approach we show that the system can produce a confined expression of hyaluronan, but only if the inhibitory signal is transferred to adjacent cells in exosomes."

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me start by parsing the original description to identify relevant terms for each ontology category.\n\nFirst, for CellOntology. The text mentions endocardial cushions and endocardial cells. Checking Cell Ontology, \"endocardial cell\" is CL:0002251. \"Endocardial cushion\" might be a structure, so maybe CL:0005002 is the right term for endocardial cushion cells.\n\nNext, GeneOntology. The process involves extracellular matrix production, so \"extracellular matrix organization\" is GO:0030198. Also, endothelial to mesenchymal transition is GO:0060973. Hyaluronan biosynthesis would be under \"hyaluronan biosynthetic process\" GO:0030212. MicroRNA activity might be \"negative regulation of gene expression\" GO:0010629, and exosome transfer could be \"exosome secretion\" GO:0070062.\n\nFor MeSH terms, \"Extracellular Matrix\" is D005109. \"Hyaluronic Acid\" is D006814. \"Endothelial-Mesenchymal Transition\" is D057706. \"MicroRNAs\" is D046911. \"Exosomes\" is D055354. \"Embryonic Development\" is D047108. \n\nNeed to ensure all IDs and terms are exact without extra spaces.
