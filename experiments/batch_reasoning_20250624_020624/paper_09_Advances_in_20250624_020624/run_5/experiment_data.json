      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by parsing the user's request. They want me to create a structured JSON object with ontology annotations based on the provided paper description. The ontologies needed are CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH. The key is to follow the formatting rules strictly.\n\nFirst, I'll look for Cell Ontology terms. The paper mentions Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), so I need the terms \"Epithelial\" and \"Mesenchymal\". Checking Cell Ontology, \"Epithelial cell\" is CL:0000066 and \"Mesenchymal cell\" is CL:0008019. Got those IDs.\n\nNext, Gene Ontology terms. The model involves cell migration (2D and 3D) and adhesion. For migration, \"Cell Migration\" is GO:0016477. Adhesion processes are mentioned, so \"Cell Adhesion\" is GO:0007155. The paper also talks about cell division in the example, but the original text doesn't mention division. Wait, the example had \"Cell Division\", but the actual paper here discusses migration and adhesion. So stick to those. \n\nNow MeSH terms. The paper involves in vitro models, so \"Models, Biological\" is D008957. EMT is a cellular process, so \"Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition\" is D057885. Also, collagen gel is used, so \"Collagen\" is D003093. Check the MeSH database to confirm these terms and IDs. \n\nWait, for MeSH, \"Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition\" is indeed D057885. \"Models, Biological\" is D008957. \"Collagen\" is D003093. All correct. \n\nNeed to ensure the category names are exact: \"CellOntology\", \"GeneOntology\", \"MeSH\". No spaces. IDs must be correctly formatted without spaces. Terms should match exactly, like \"Epithelial\" and \"Mesenchymal\" as per the user's example, even though the full term in Cell Ontology might be \"epithelial cell\". Wait, the user specified term names must be exact. The example used \"Epithelial\" instead of \"epithelial cell\". Hmm, the original description says \"Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT)\", so maybe the terms should be \"Epithelial\" and \"Mesenchymal\". But in Cell Ontology, the terms are \"epithelial cell\" and \"mesenchymal cell\". However, the user's example shows \"Epithelial\" as the term. Wait, in their example, they have \"Epithelial\" under CellOntology with ID CL:0000000. So maybe they want the term names as the general process, but that's conflicting. Wait, the user's example is just an example. Let's check actual Cell Ontology entries. \n\nLooking up CL:0000066, the term is \"epithelial cell\", so the term should be \"epithelial cell\". But the user's example uses \"Epithelial\" as the term. Wait, the user's instruction says \"Term names must be exact without extra spaces\". So probably, I need to use the exact term name from the ontology. But the user's example uses \"Epithelial\" which isn't the exact term. There's inconsistency here. But according to the user's instructions, they require the term names to be exact. So perhaps the example is simplified, but the actual answer should use the exact term from the ontology. \n\nWait, the user says: \"Term names must be exact without extra spaces\". So if the ontology term is \"epithelial cell\", then the term should be written exactly as \"epithelial cell\". However, in the example provided, they have \"Epithelial\" which is not matching the actual term. That's conflicting. But perhaps the user wants the term as it's commonly referred, like \"Epithelial\" instead of the full term. This is a problem. \n\nBut the user's example is just illustrative. The actual answer should use the correct term from the ontology. Let me check:\n\n- For CL:0000066, the term is \"epithelial cell\". So the term should be \"epithelial cell\".\n- For CL:0008019, the term is \"mesenchymal cell\".\n\nBut the original description mentions \"Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT)\", which are the processes. However, the Cell Ontology terms are for cell types. So the CellOntology entries should be the cell types involved. So epithelial cell and mesenchymal cell. Therefore, the terms should be \"epithelial cell\" and \"mesenchymal cell\".\n\nBut the user's example uses \"Epithelial\" as the term. Maybe the user made a mistake in the example. But according to their instructions, we must follow the term names exactly. Therefore, I should use the exact terms from the ontology. So \"epithelial cell\" and \"mesenchymal cell\".\n\nSimilarly, for Gene Ontology terms:\n\n- \"Cell migration\" is GO:0016477, term name \"cell migration\".\n- \"Cell adhesion\" is GO:0007155, term name \"cell adhesion\".\n\nBut the user's example capitalizes the terms like \"Cell Division\". However, the actual GO terms are lowercase. But in the example provided by the user, they wrote \"Cell Division\" with capital letters. So perhaps they want the term names capitalized as in the example. Wait, the user says: \"Term names must be exact without extra spaces\". So if the actual term in the ontology is \"cell division\", then it should be written as \"cell division\". But the example shows \"Cell Division\" with capitals. This is conflicting. \n\nLooking up GO:0007155, the term is \"cell adhesion\" (lowercase). However, in some databases, it might be displayed with initial capitals. But the official GO terms are in lowercase. However, the user's example uses \"Cell Division\" with capitals, which is not the official term. So perhaps the user wants the term names as they appear in the ontology, but the example is incorrect. But following the user's instructions strictly, we need to use the exact term names. \n\nBut how to resolve this? Let me check:\n\nIn the Gene Ontology, the term for GO:0007155 is \"cell adhesion\" (all lowercase). So the term should be \"cell adhesion\". But the user's example uses \"Cell Division\" with capitals. This suggests that maybe the user expects the terms to be capitalized as in the example. However, the instructions state that term names must be exact. Therefore, we should use the exact term as per the ontology. Therefore, \"cell adhesion\" and \"cell migration\".\n\nBut this might conflict with the example. The user's example might be simplified. However, the user's instructions take precedence. So, in the answer, the terms should be exactly as in the ontology, even if they are lowercase. But the user's example has \"Cell Division\" with capitals. Hmm. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Alternatively, perhaps the user is okay with the capitalization as in the example. Since the example uses \"Cell Division\", which is not the exact term (the exact term is \"cell division\"), but the user provided that in their example, maybe they want the terms to be capitalized. \n\nThis is a bit of a dilemma. The user's instructions say to use exact term names, but their example uses a different format. To adhere strictly to the user's example, maybe capitalize the first letter of each word. However, in reality, that's not how the terms are written. \n\nGiven that the user provided the example with \"Cell Division\" (GO:0000000), which is not a real ID, but in the real case, the term would be lowercase. However, the user's instruction says to follow term names exactly. Therefore, we must use the exact term from the ontology, even if it's lowercase. \n\nBut perhaps the user is unaware of the exact formatting and wants the terms capitalized. Alternatively, maybe the user's example is incorrect, and we should follow the actual ontology terms. \n\nThis is a critical point. If I follow the user's example, I might be wrong. But the user's instructions say term names must be exact. Therefore, I have to use the exact terms as they are in the ontology, even if they are in lowercase. \n\nTherefore, for GeneOntology terms:\n\n- \"cell migration\" (GO:0016477)\n- \"cell adhesion\" (GO:0007155)\n\nBut the user's example uses \"Cell Division\" (capitalized). So there's a conflict. The user might expect the terms to be capitalized. However, according to the instructions, we must use exact term names. Therefore, lowercase is correct.\n\nFor MeSH terms:\n\n- \"Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition\" is the MeSH term (D057885). The exact term is \"Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition\".\n- \"Models, Biological\" (D008957)\n- \"Collagen\" (D003093)\n\nThese are exact MeSH terms. \n\nPutting it all together:\n\nCellOntology entries:\n- CL:0000066 for epithelial cell\n- CL:0008019 for mesenchymal cell\n\nGeneOntology entries:\n- GO:0016477 for cell migration\n- GO:0007155 for cell adhesion\n\nMeSH entries:\n- D057885 for Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition\n- D008957 for Models, Biological\n- D003093 for Collagen\n\nNow, check for any other terms. The paper uses a cellular Potts model, but that's a computational model. MeSH term for \"Models, Theoretical\" is D052061, but the paper is about in vitro models, so \"Models"
