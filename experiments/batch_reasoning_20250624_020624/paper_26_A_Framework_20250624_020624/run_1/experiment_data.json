      "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a JSON object with ontology annotations for the provided information about COMPUCELL3D. Let me start by breaking down the original description to identify relevant terms.\n\nThe software is for 3D simulation of morphogenesis. Morphogenesis is a biological process, so I should check Gene Ontology (GO) for terms like \"morphogenesis\" and \"pattern specification\". The GO term for morphogenesis is GO:0009653, and for pattern specification, maybe GO:0007389. \n\nNext, the models include cell clustering, growth, and interaction with chemical fields. Cell growth could be GO:0016049, and cell-cell adhesion might be relevant for clustering, which is GO:0098602. Chemical interaction might relate to \"response to chemical\" under GO:0042221.\n\nThe application is in the avian limb bud, specifically skeletal pattern formation. The MeSH term for limb bud could be D054883. Morphogenesis in general is D009024. Skeletal development might be D018782. \n\nCellOntology terms might include mesenchymal cells (CL:0008019) and epithelial cells (CL:0000066) since morphogenesis often involves these cell types. Also, stem cells (CL:0000034) could be involved in growth.\n\nI need to ensure the category names are exact: \"CellOntology\", \"GeneOntology\", \"MeSH\". Check the IDs for correct formatting without spaces. Terms should be exact, like \"Epithelial\" not \"Epithelial Cell\". \n\nWait, the example uses \"Epithelial\" as a term, but the actual CL term for epithelial cell is \"epithelial cell\". But the user's example shows \"Epithelial\" as the term. But I need to use the exact term from the ontology. Let me verify.\n\nLooking up CL:0000066, the term is \"epithelial cell\". So the term should be \"epithelial cell\". But the user's example has \"Epithelial\" as the term. Hmm, maybe the user simplified it, but the instructions say to use exact term names. So I need to use the exact term from the ontology, which includes \"cell\" in this case. But wait, the user's example shows \"Epithelial\" as the term, which is not the exact term. That's conflicting. Wait, the user's instructions say: \"Term names must be exact without extra spaces\". So I should use the exact term as per the ontology, even if the example is simplified. But maybe the example was a mistake. Let me check.\n\nFor instance, in the example, \"Epithelial\" is given as a term, but the correct CL term is \"epithelial cell\". But perhaps the user wants the term as per the example. Wait, the user's instruction says: \"Term names must be exact without extra spaces\". Therefore, I should use the exact term from the ontology. So for CL:0000066, the term is \"epithelial cell\". Similarly, mesenchymal cell is CL:0008019, term \"mesenchymal cell\". But the user's example uses \"Epithelial\" instead of \"epithelial cell\". This is a problem. Do I follow the example or the instruction?\n\nThe user's instructions are conflicting here. The example shows \"Epithelial\" as the term, but the actual ontology term is \"epithelial cell\". The user says term names must be exact. Therefore, I should use the exact term from the ontology, even if the example is incorrect. So in this case, for epithelial cells, the term is \"epithelial cell\".\n\nBut the original description mentions \"skeletal pattern formation in the avian limb bud\". The limb bud involves mesenchymal cells, so CL:0008019 \"mesenchymal cell\". Also, epithelial cells might be involved in morphogenesis. Stem cells (CL:0000034) could be part of growth.\n\nFor GeneOntology, morphogenesis (GO:0009653), pattern specification (GO:0007389), cell growth (GO:0016049), cell-cell adhesion (GO:0098602), response to chemical (GO:0042221).\n\nMeSH terms: Morphogenesis (D009024), Limb Buds (D054883), Skeletal Development (D018782).\n\nWait, the original description mentions \"skeletal pattern formation\", so maybe \"Skeletal Development\" as MeSH term D018782. Also, \"Cell Proliferation\" might be relevant, which is D002460. But the example uses \"Cell Proliferation\" under MeSH. However, the original text mentions cell growth, which is related to proliferation. So including D002460 for Cell Proliferation.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nCellOntology:\n- CL:0000066 (epithelial cell)\n- CL:0008019 (mesenchymal cell)\n- CL:0000034 (stem cell)\n\nGeneOntology:\n- GO:0009653 (morphogenesis)\n- GO:0007389 (pattern specification)\n- GO:0016049 (cell growth)\n- GO:0098602 (cell-cell adhesion)\n- GO:0042221 (response to chemical)\n\nMeSH:\n- D009024 (Morphogenesis)\n- D054883 (Limb Buds)\n- D018782 (Skeletal Development)\n- D002460 (Cell Proliferation)\n\nI need to check if all these terms are accurate. For example, \"pattern specification\" in GO is GO:0007389, which is \"pattern specification involved in regionalization\". The original text mentions \"skeletal pattern formation\", so that term might fit. \"Cell clustering\" could relate to cell adhesion. \"Interaction with chemical fields\" relates to response to chemical.\n\nYes, this seems correct. Now, format the JSON with exact category names and IDs without spaces.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000066\",\n            \"term\": \"epithelial cell\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0008019\",\n            \"term\": \"mesenchymal cell\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000034\",\n            \"term\": \"stem cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0009653\",\n            \"term\": \"morphogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0007389\",\n            \"term\": \"pattern specification\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0016049\",\n            \"term\": \"cell growth\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0098602\",\n            \"term\": \"cell-cell adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0042221\",\n            \"term\": \"response to chemical\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D009024\",\n            \"term\": \"Morphogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D054883\",\n            \"term\": \"Limb Buds\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D018782\",\n            \"term\": \"Skeletal Development\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D002460\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Proliferation\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"
