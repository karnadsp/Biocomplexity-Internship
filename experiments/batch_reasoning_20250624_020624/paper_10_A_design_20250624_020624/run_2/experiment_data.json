However, an increasing number of studies have indicated that E3 ubiquitin ligases also participate in transcription. Intrigued by the apparently paradoxical functions of E3 ubiquitin ligases in both proteolysis and transcriptional activation, we investigated the underlying design principles using mathematical modeling. We found that the antagonistic functions integrated in E3 ubiquitin ligases can prevent any undesirable sustained activation of downstream genes when E3 ubiquitin ligases are destabilized by unexpected perturbations. Interestingly, this design principle of the system is similar to the operational principle of a safety interlock device in engineering systems, which prevents a system from abnormal operation unless stability is guaranteed."

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a JSON object with ontology annotations based on the provided information. The user wants CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH terms. Let me start by parsing the original description and the clarifications.\n\nThe main topic here is E3 ubiquitin ligases and their roles in proteolysis and transcription. The study uses mathematical modeling to explore their antagonistic functions. \n\nFor CellOntology, the text mentions cellular components but doesn't specify particular cell types. However, terms like \"Epithelial\" or \"Mesenchymal\" aren't directly relevant here. Maybe there's a general term for cells involved in these processes. Wait, since the focus is on the ubiquitin-proteasome system and transcription, perhaps there's a cell ontology term related to generic cells. But if there's no specific cell type mentioned, maybe CellOntology isn't applicable here. The user might expect me to include something, but I need to check if any cell types are mentioned. The original text doesn't specify, so maybe CellOntology should be empty. Let me double-check. The example had \"Epithelial\" under CellOntology, but unless the input mentions specific cells, it's better to leave it out. So maybe CellOntology array is empty.\n\nNext, GeneOntology. The E3 ubiquitin ligases are involved in proteolysis and transcription. So relevant GO terms would be \"Ubiquitin-protein ligase activity\" (GO:0061630) and \"Transcription, DNA-templated\" (GO:0006351). Also, the proteasome system is part of protein catabolic process (GO:0030163). Additionally, the study uses mathematical modeling, so maybe \"Biological regulation\" (GO:0065007) or \"Regulation of transcription\" (GO:0045944). Let me check the exact terms. \"Ubiquitin-protein ligase activity\" is correct (GO:0061630). For transcription, \"DNA-templated transcription\" is GO:0006351. The proteolysis part could be \"Proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process\" (GO:0043161). Alternatively, \"Protein ubiquitination\" (GO:0016567). But the text mentions proteolysis in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, so GO:0043161 might be better. Also, the study talks about transcriptional activation, so \"Positive regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II\" (GO:0045944). Let me confirm the IDs. \n\nFor MeSH terms, the topics are ubiquitin-proteasome system, transcription factors, mathematical models, and maybe systems biology. MeSH terms could include \"Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases\" (D017386), \"Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex\" (D020521), \"Transcription, Genetic\" (D014158), and \"Systems Biology\" (D058109). Also, \"Models, Theoretical\" (D008962) for the mathematical modeling part. Let me check MeSH terms. \"Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases\" is D017386. \"Transcription, Genetic\" is D014158. \"Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex\" is D020521. \"Systems Biology\" is D058109. \"Models, Theoretical\" is D008962. Those fit.\n\nSo assembling these:\n\nGeneOntology:\n- GO:0061630 for Ubiquitin-protein ligase activity\n- GO:0006351 for DNA-templated transcription\n- GO:0043161 for Proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process\n- GO:0045944 for Positive regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II\n\nMeSH:\n- D017386 Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases\n- D014158 Transcription, Genetic\n- D020521 Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex\n- D058109 Systems Biology\n- D008962 Models, Theoretical\n\nCellOntology: No specific cell types mentioned, so leave empty.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0061630\",\n            \"term\": \"Ubiquitin-protein ligase activity\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0006351\",\n            \"term\": \"DNA-templated transcription\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0043161\",\n            \"term\": \"Proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0045944\",\n            \"term\": \"Positive regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D017386\",\n            \"term\": \"Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D014158\",\n            \"term\": \"Transcription, Genetic\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D020521\",\n            \"term\": \"Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D058109\",\n            \"term\": \"Systems Biology\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D008962\",\n            \"term\": \"Models, Theoretical\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"
