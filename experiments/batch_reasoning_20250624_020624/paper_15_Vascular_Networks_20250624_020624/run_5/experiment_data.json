      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants ontology annotations based on the provided information, specifically using Cell Ontology, Gene Ontology (GO), and MeSH terms. First, I need to parse the original description and identify relevant concepts.\n\nThe original text talks about cell ordering in tissues, crystallization analogies, morphogenesis, a computational model with elongated cells forming networks, and mentions intercellular interactions like chemotaxis or mechanical traction. \n\nFor Cell Ontology, terms related to cell types involved in morphogenesis and tissue structure. \"Epithelial cell\" might be relevant, but the text mentions \"elongated, cohering biological cells\" forming networks. Maybe \"Mesenchymal cell\" since they are often elongated. Checking Cell Ontology, \"CL:0000009\" is Mesenchymal Stem Cell, but maybe \"Mesenchymal cell\" is CL:0008019? Wait, need to verify. Alternatively, \"Stromal cell\" (CL:0000499) might be involved in tissue structure. Hmm, but the text emphasizes elongation and network formation. Maybe \"Fibroblast\" (CL:0000057)? Fibroblasts are mesenchymal cells involved in tissue structure. Alternatively, maybe \"Epithelial cell\" if the network formation relates to epithelial tissues, but the model uses elongated cells, which are more mesenchymal. Let me check Cell Ontology terms. CL:0008019 is indeed \"mesenchymal cell\". So that's a candidate.\n\nGene Ontology terms: The study involves cell ordering, pattern formation during morphogenesis. Processes like \"cell-cell adhesion\" (GO:0098602) since cohering cells are mentioned. Also, \"morphogenesis\" (GO:0009653), and maybe \"cell migration\" (GO:0016477) but the model excludes chemotaxis and mechanical traction. Alternatively, \"pattern specification\" (GO:0007389) or \"tissue morphogenesis\" (GO:0048729). The formation of networks could relate to \"anatomical structure formation involved in morphogenesis\" (GO:0048646). Let me confirm the exact terms and IDs. GO:0048646 is correct. Also, \"cell adhesion\" (GO:0007155) might be relevant for cohering cells.\n\nMeSH terms: Topics like \"Morphogenesis\" (D009024), \"Cell Adhesion\" (D015815), \"Models, Biological\" (D008957), \"Cell Culture Techniques\" (D016912), and \"Cell Movement\" (D002465). The study uses a computational model, so \"Models, Biological\" is appropriate. The exclusion of chemotaxis or mechanical traction might relate to specific MeSH terms, but those are excluded in the model. The main focus is on cell ordering and pattern formation, so \"Morphogenesis\" and \"Cell Adhesion\" are key. Also, \"Cell Proliferation\" (D002460) is mentioned in the example but the original text doesn't focus on proliferation. Alternatively, \"Cell Differentiation\" (D002454) if applicable. But the text is about ordering and network formation, so \"Morphogenesis\" and \"Models, Biological\" are safe. \n\nDouble-checking the exact term names and IDs to match the required formatting. Ensuring no extra spaces in term names and correct IDs. For example, \"Mesenchymal\" as a term might be \"Mesenchymal cell\" in Cell Ontology. Wait, the example uses \"Epithelial\" as the term, but the correct term in Cell Ontology for epithelial cell is \"epithelial cell\". The user specified term names must be exact. So if the correct term is \"mesenchymal cell\", it should be written as \"mesenchymal cell\" with lowercase? Wait, no, the example uses \"Epithelial\" with a capital E. But Cell Ontology terms are usually capitalized. For instance, \"Epithelial cell\" (CL:0000066). Wait, checking the Cell Ontology database: \"epithelial cell\" is CL:0000066, but the term name is \"epithelial cell\" with lowercase. However, the example given by the user uses \"Epithelial\" (capitalized). The user's example shows \"Epithelial\" without the \"cell\" part, but that might not be the actual term. Hmm, this is conflicting. The user says term names must be exact. So if the actual term in Cell Ontology is \"epithelial cell\", then the term should be written as \"epithelial cell\". But the example shows \"Epithelial\". That might be an inconsistency. Wait, looking at the user's example:\n\nIn the example, CellOntology has term \"Epithelial\" with ID \"CL:0000000\". However, checking Cell Ontology, the correct ID for epithelial cell is CL:0000066, and the term is \"epithelial cell\". So the example might be simplified. But the user's instruction says to use exact term names. So I need to use the exact term as per the ontology. However, the user's example uses \"Epithelial\" instead of the full term. This is a problem. The user might have a mistake in their example, but their instruction says term names must be exact. Therefore, I should look up the exact terms.\n\nLooking up \"mesenchymal cell\" in Cell Ontology: CL:0008019 is \"mesenchymal cell\". Similarly, \"epithelial cell\" is CL:0000066. So the terms should include \"cell\" in the name. However, the example in the user's message shows \"Epithelial\" as the term. That suggests that perhaps the user expects the term to be shortened. But according to their own instructions, term names must be exact. Therefore, I should use the exact term from the ontology. But this is conflicting. Alternatively, maybe the example is just illustrative and the actual terms should be exact. The user's example might have a typo. Given that, I need to proceed with the exact terms.\n\nSo, for the given text, the cells are elongated and cohering, forming networks. Mesenchymal cells are typically elongated, so CL:0008019 \"mesenchymal cell\" would be appropriate. Then, for Gene Ontology, terms related to morphogenesis (GO:0009653) and cell-cell adhesion (GO:0098602). Also, anatomical structure formation involved in morphogenesis (GO:0048646). For MeSH, Morphogenesis (D009024), Cell Adhesion (D015815), Models, Biological (D008957), and possibly others. \n\nWait, the original text mentions a computational model explaining network formation in culture systems. So MeSH terms like \"Models, Biological\" (D008957) and \"Cell Culture Techniques\" (D016912). Also, \"Cell Communication\" (D002465) but the model excludes chemotaxis and mechanical traction, so maybe not. The focus is on cell ordering and solidification analogies, so \"Morphogenesis\" and \"Models, Biological\" are key. \n\nPutting this together, the JSON should have:\n\nCellOntology: mesenchymal cell (CL:0008019)\nGeneOntology: anatomical structure formation involved in morphogenesis (GO:0048646), cell-cell adhesion (GO:0098602), morphogenesis (GO:0009653)\nMeSH: Morphogenesis (D009024), Models, Biological (D008957), Cell Culture Techniques (D016912), Cell Adhesion (D015815)\n\nChecking the IDs again to ensure correctness:\n\n- CL:0008019 is correct for mesenchymal cell.\n- GO:0048646 is \"anatomical structure formation involved in morphogenesis\"\n- GO:0098602 is \"cell-cell adhesion\"\n- GO:0009653 is \"morphogenesis\"\n- MeSH D009024 is \"Morphogenesis\"\n- D008957 is \"Models, Biological\"\n- D016912 is \"Cell Culture Techniques\"\n- D015815 is \"Cell Adhesion\"\n\nThat seems right. Now, format the JSON exactly as specified, with proper categories and no extra spaces. Ensure the category names are exact, IDs without spaces, and terms exact.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0008019\",\n            \"term\": \"mesenchymal cell\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0048646\",\n            \"term\": \"anatomical structure formation involved in morphogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0098602\",\n            \"term\": \"cell-cell adhesion\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0009653\",\n            \"term\": \"morphogenesis\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D009024\",\n            \"term\": \"Morphogenesis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D008957\",\n            \"term\": \"Models, Biological\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D016912\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Culture Techniques\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D015815\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Adhesion\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"

Basic cell types and parameters based on the ontology annotations",
      "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file based on the given ontology annotations. Let's start by recalling the structure of a typical CompuCell3D Python script. The user specified that the code must include required imports, a simulation class inheriting from SteppableBasePy, and the __init__, start, and step methods. Also, basic cell types and parameters based on the provided ontologies.\n\nFirst, the imports. The essential ones are CompuCellSetup and the steppables module. So I'll import those. Also, maybe need sys for some setup, but let me check if that's necessary. Oh, right, sometimes you see import sys in examples, but maybe not required here. Let's stick to the basics.\n\nNext, the simulation class. It should inherit from steppables.SteppableBasePy. The class will have __init__, start, and step methods. In the __init__, I need to call the parent class's __init__ using super. The start method is where the simulation initializes cells, and step is called every simulation step.\n\nLooking at the ontology annotations: mesenchymal cells are the cell type involved. The GeneOntology terms include morphogenesis, anatomical structure formation in morphogenesis, and cell-cell adhesion. MeSH terms include Cell Adhesion, Cell Culture Techniques, Morphogenesis, and Biological Models. So the simulation should model cell adhesion and morphogenesis processes.\n\nIn CompuCell3D, cell adhesion is typically handled by the Contact plugin, which uses adhesion energies between cell types. So I need to set up the contact energy parameters. The cell types involved here are mesenchymal cells and maybe a medium cell type. So I'll define those.\n\nIn the start method, I'll create a cell field and maybe initialize a cluster of mesenchymal cells. Using a blob shape could work. The step method can be used to apply some directional bias to simulate morphogenesis, maybe using a chemotaxis plugin, but since the user didn't mention specific plugins, perhaps just a basic movement. Alternatively, since the step method is present, maybe adjust lambda vectors for cell adhesion forces. Wait, but the example might need to include some basic cell behaviors.\n\nAlso, the volume and surface constraints are important. So in the start method, I should set the target volume and lambda parameters for the cells. For mesenchymal cells, set vol=25, maybe. Then, the contact energy between mesenchymal cells and medium would influence adhesion. Let's say lower adhesion energy between cell and medium to promote sticking together.\n\nPutting it all together: the XML part isn't needed here since the user wants a Python script. The CompuCell3D setup is done via Python. So in the code, after defining the steppable, register it with CompuCellSetup.\n\nWait, in the code structure, the user might need to create a simulation object, set up the simulator, and register the steppable. Let me recall the standard template. The main function usually initializes the simulator, registers steppables, and runs. But the user might want the code to be concise. Let me check a minimal example.\n\nHere's a minimal structure:\n\nimport CompuCellSetup\nfrom PySteppables import *\n\nclass SimulationSteppable(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, simulator, _frequency=1):\n        super().__init__(simulator, _frequency)\n        \n    def start(self):\n        # Initialize cells here\n        pass\n        \n    def step(self, mcs):\n        # Code to run each step\n        pass\n\nCompuCellSetup.register_steppable(steppable=SimulationSteppable(frequency=1))\nCompuCellSetup.run()\n\nBut according to the user's request, the code must include the proper simulation class, which inherits from steppables.SteppableBasePy. Wait, the correct base class is SteppableBasePy from the PySteppables module. So the imports are correct.\n\nNow, for the cell types. In the start method, we need to define the cell types. Using self.cellType will require getting the cell type from the simulator. So, for example:\n\ncell_type = self.cellType.MESENCHYMAL\nmedium_type = self.cellType.MEDIUM\n\nBut wait, how are the cell types defined in CompuCell3D? Typically, you can use the cell types defined in the XML, but here since it's Python-only, maybe define them using the simulator's object. Alternatively, the code might use the CellTypePlugin. Let me think: in the start method, you can access the cell types via the simulator's object. So in the start method, perhaps:\n\nmesenchymal_type = self.cellType.MESENCHYMAL\n\nBut first, need to make sure that the cell types are declared. So in the XML configuration, but since we're not using XML, maybe in the Python script. Wait, no, in CompuCell3D's Python setup, the cell types can be managed via the plugin system. The user's code should include the necessary plugins. So perhaps the code should include the VolumePlugin, ContactPlugin, and others. But the user didn't mention plugins, but the ontology includes cell adhesion, so the ContactPlugin is necessary.\n\nWait, but the user's code must include basic parameters. So in the start method, we can set the contact energies. For example:\n\nself.get_xml_element('Plugin Name=\"Contact\"').findElement('Energy', {'Type1': 'Medium', 'Type2': 'Medium'}).setDoubleValue(10)\nBut maybe that's not the right way. Alternatively, in the Python code, using the contact plugin's API. But perhaps in CompuCell3D's Python interface, you can set contact energy via:\n\nself.contact_plugin.set_contact_energy(cell_type1, cell_type2, energy)\n\nSo, to set the contact energy between mesenchymal and medium cells, perhaps:\n\nself.contact_plugin.set_contact_energy(\"Medium\", \"Mesenchymal\", 15)\nself.contact_plugin.set_contact_energy(\"Mesenchymal\", \"Mesenchymal\", 10)\n\nBut first, we need to make sure that the Contact plugin is loaded. So in the code, perhaps in the __init__ method, we can get the plugin:\n\nself.contact_plugin = CompuCell.getContactEnergyPlugin()\n\nWait, but in Python, the way to access plugins might be through the simulator object. Let me check. The correct way is to use the simulator's object passed to the steppable. So in the __init__:\n\ndef __init__(self, simulator, frequency=1):\n    SteppableBasePy.__init__(self, simulator, frequency)\n    self.contact_plugin = self.get_contact_energy_plugin()\n\nWait, maybe there's a method to get the contact plugin. Alternatively, in CompuCell3D's Python API, plugins can be accessed via self.simulator.getPluginManager().getPlugin('Contact'). So perhaps:\n\nself.contact_plugin = self.simulator.getPluginManager().getPlugin('Contact')\n\nThen, in the start method, set the contact energies. But for this, the cell types must be defined. So, perhaps in the start method, we define the cell types.\n\nSo, the code steps would be:\n\n1. Import necessary modules.\n\n2. Create a simulation class that inherits from SteppableBasePy.\n\n3. In the __init__ method, initialize the contact plugin.\n\n4. In the start method:\n\n   a. Define cell types (Mesenchymal and Medium).\n\n   b. Set contact energies between cell types.\n\n   c. Create initial cells (e.g., a cluster of mesenchymal cells surrounded by medium).\n\n   d. Set volume and surface constraints for the cells.\n\n5. In the step method, maybe adjust some parameters over time, but the user didn't specify, so perhaps leave it empty or add a basic print statement.\n\nPutting this into code:\n\nFirst, the imports:\n\nimport CompuCellSetup\nfrom PySteppables import SteppableBasePy\n\nThen, the simulation class:\n\nclass MorphogenesisSteppable(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, simulator, frequency=1):\n        super().__init__(simulator, frequency)\n        self.contact_plugin = None\n\n    def start(self):\n        # Define cell types\n        mesenchymal_type = self.cell_type(\"Mesenchymal\")\n        medium_type = self.cell_type(\"Medium\")\n        \n        # Set contact energies\n        self.contact_plugin.set_contact_energy(\"Mesenchymal\", \"Mesenchymal\", 10)\n        self.contact_plugin.set_contact_energy(\"Mesenchymal\", \"Medium\", 15)\n        self.contact_plugin.set_contact_energy(\"Medium\", \"Medium\", 5)\n        \n        # Create initial cell layout\n        cell = self.new_cell(self.cell_type.MESENCHYMAL)\n        self.cell_field[25:35, 25:35, 0] = cell\n        \n        # Set volume and surface parameters\n        self.cell_volume_plugin.set_volume_parameters(cell, target_volume=25, lambda_volume=2.0)\n        self.cell_volume_plugin.set_surface_parameters(cell, target_surface=20, lambda_surface=1.5)\n    \n    def step(self, mcs):\n        # Example step behavior: adjust properties based on mcs\n        pass\n\nWait, but in the start method, how are the cell types defined? Maybe using self.c"

Therefore, I should look up the exact terms.\n\nLooking up \"mesenchymal cell\" in Cell Ontology: CL:0008019 is \"mesenchymal cell\". Similarly, \"epithelial cell\" is CL:0000066. So the terms should include \"cell\" in the name. However, the example in the user's message shows \"Epithelial\" as the term. That suggests that perhaps the user expects the term to be shortened. But according to their own instructions, term names must be exact. Therefore, I should use the exact term from the ontology. But this is conflicting. Alternatively, maybe the example is just illustrative and the actual terms should be exact. The user's example might have a typo. Given that, I need to proceed with the exact terms.\n\nSo, for the given text, the cells are elongated and cohering, forming networks. Mesenchymal cells are typically elongated, so CL:0008019 \"mesenchymal cell\" would be appropriate. Then, for Gene Ontology, terms related to morphogenesis (GO:0009653) and cell-cell adhesion (GO:0098602). Also, anatomical structure formation involved in morphogenesis (GO:0048646). For MeSH, Morphogenesis (D009024), Cell Adhesion (D015815), Models, Biological (D008957), and possibly others. \n\nWait, the original text mentions a computational model explaining network formation in culture systems. So MeSH terms like \"Models, Biological\" (D008957) and \"Cell Culture Techniques\" (D016912). Also, \"Cell Communication\" (D002465) but the model excludes chemotaxis and mechanical traction, so maybe not. The focus is on cell ordering and solidification analogies, so \"Morphogenesis\" and \"Models, Biological\" are key. \n\nPutting this together, the JSON should have:\n\nCellOntology: mesenchymal cell (CL:0008019)\nGeneOntology: anatomical structure formation involved in morphogenesis (GO:0048646), cell-cell adhesion (GO:0098602), morphogenesis (GO:0009653)\nMeSH: Morphogenesis (D009024), Models, Biological (D008957), Cell Culture Techniques (D016912), Cell Adhesion (D015815)\n\nChecking the IDs again to ensure correctness:\n\n- CL:0008019 is correct for mesenchymal cell.\n- GO:0048646 is \"anatomical structure formation involved in morphogenesis\"\n- GO:0098602 is \"cell-cell adhesion\"\n- GO:0009653 is \"morphogenesis\"\n- MeSH D009024 is \"Morphogenesis\"\n- D008957 is \"Models, Biological\"\n- D016912 is \"Cell Culture Techniques\"\n- D015815 is \"Cell Adhesion\"\n\nThat seems right. Now, format the JSON exactly as specified, with proper categories and no extra spaces. Ensure the category names are exact, IDs without spaces, and terms exact.\n</think>",

      "python_code": "from cc3d.core.PySteppables import *\n\n<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file based on the given ontology annotations. Let's start by recalling the structure of a typical CompuCell3D Python script. The user specified that the code must include required imports, a simulation class inheriting from SteppableBasePy, and the __init__, start, and step methods. Also, basic cell types and parameters based on the provided ontologies.\n\nFirst, the imports. The essential ones are CompuCellSetup and the steppables module. So I'll import those. Also, maybe need sys for some setup, but let me check if that's necessary. Oh, right, sometimes you see import sys in examples, but maybe not required here. Let's stick to the basics.\n\nNext, the simulation class. It should inherit from steppables.SteppableBasePy. The class will have __init__, start, and step methods. In the __init__, I need to call the parent class's __init__ using super. The start method is where the simulation initializes cells, and step is called every simulation step.\n\nLooking at the ontology annotations: mesenchymal cells are the cell type involved. The GeneOntology terms include morphogenesis, anatomical structure formation in morphogenesis, and cell-cell adhesion. MeSH terms include Cell Adhesion, Cell Culture Techniques, Morphogenesis, and Biological Models. So the simulation should model cell adhesion and morphogenesis processes.\n\nIn CompuCell3D, cell adhesion is typically handled by the Contact plugin, which uses adhesion energies between cell types. So I need to set up the contact energy parameters. The cell types involved here are mesenchymal cells and maybe a medium cell type. So I'll define those.\n\nIn the start method, I'll create a cell field and maybe initialize a cluster of mesenchymal cells. Using a blob shape could work. The step method can be used to apply some directional bias to simulate morphogenesis, maybe using a chemotaxis plugin, but since the user didn't mention specific plugins, perhaps just a basic movement. Alternatively, since the step method is present, maybe adjust lambda vectors for cell adhesion forces. Wait, but the example might need to include some basic cell behaviors.\n\nAlso, the volume and surface constraints are important. So in the start method, I should set the target volume and lambda parameters for the cells. For mesenchymal cells, set vol=25, maybe. Then, the contact energy between mesenchymal cells and medium would influence adhesion. Let's say lower adhesion energy between cell and medium to promote sticking together.\n\nPutting it all together: the XML part isn't needed here since the user wants a Python script. The CompuCell3D setup is done via Python. So in the code, after defining the steppable, register it with CompuCellSetup.\n\nWait, in the code structure, the user might need to create a simulation object, set up the simulator, and register the steppable. Let me recall the standard template. The main function usually initializes the simulator, registers steppables, and runs. But the user might want the code to be concise. Let me check a minimal example.\n\nHere's a minimal structure:\n\nimport CompuCellSetup\nfrom PySteppables import *\n\nclass SimulationSteppable(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, simulator, _frequency=1):\n        super().__init__(simulator, _frequency)\n        \n    def start(self):\n        # Initialize cells here\n        pass\n        \n    def step(self, mcs):\n        # Code to run each step\n        pass\n\nCompuCellSetup.register_steppable(steppable=SimulationSteppable(frequency=1))\nCompuCellSetup.run()\n\nBut according to the user's request, the code must include the proper simulation class, which inherits from steppables.SteppableBasePy. Wait, the correct base class is SteppableBasePy from the PySteppables module. So the imports are correct.\n\nNow, for the cell types. In the start method, we need to define the cell types. Using self.cellType will require getting the cell type from the simulator. So, for example:\n\ncell_type = self.cellType.MESENCHYMAL\nmedium_type = self.cellType.MEDIUM\n\nBut wait, how are the cell types defined in CompuCell3D? Typically, you can use the cell types defined in the XML, but here since it's Python-only, maybe define them using the simulator's object. Alternatively, the code might use the CellTypePlugin. Let me think: in the start method, you can access the cell types via the simulator's object. So in the start method, perhaps:\n\nmesenchymal_type = self.cellType.MESENCHYMAL\n\nBut first, need to make sure that the cell types are declared. So in the XML configuration, but since we're not using XML, maybe in the Python script. Wait, no, in CompuCell3D's Python setup, the cell types can be managed via the plugin system. The user's code should include the necessary plugins. So perhaps the code should include the VolumePlugin, ContactPlugin, and others. But the user didn't mention plugins, but the ontology includes cell adhesion, so the ContactPlugin is necessary.\n\nWait, but the user's code must include basic parameters. So in the start method, we can set the contact energies. For example:\n\nself.get_xml_element('Plugin Name=\"Contact\"').findElement('Energy', {'Type1': 'Medium', 'Type2': 'Medium'}).setDoubleValue(10)\nBut maybe that's not the right way. Alternatively, in the Python code, using the contact plugin's API. But perhaps in CompuCell3D's Python interface, you can set contact energy via:\n\nself.contact_plugin.set_contact_energy(cell_type1, cell_type2, energy)\n\nSo, to set the contact energy between mesenchymal and medium cells, perhaps:\n\nself.contact_plugin.set_contact_energy(\"Medium\", \"Mesenchymal\", 15)\nself.contact_plugin.set_contact_energy(\"Mesenchymal\", \"Mesenchymal\", 10)\n\nBut first, we need to make sure that the Contact plugin is loaded. So in the code, perhaps in the __init__ method, we can get the plugin:\n\nself.contact_plugin = CompuCell.getContactEnergyPlugin()\n\nWait, but in Python, the way to access plugins might be through the simulator object. Let me check. The correct way is to use the simulator's object passed to the steppable. So in the __init__:\n\ndef __init__(self, simulator, frequency=1):\n    SteppableBasePy.__init__(self, simulator, frequency)\n    self.contact_plugin = self.get_contact_energy_plugin()\n\nWait, maybe there's a method to get the contact plugin. Alternatively, in CompuCell3D's Python API, plugins can be accessed via self.simulator.getPluginManager().getPlugin('Contact'). So perhaps:\n\nself.contact_plugin = self.simulator.getPluginManager().getPlugin('Contact')\n\nThen, in the start method, set the contact energies. But for this, the cell types must be defined. So, perhaps in the start method, we define the cell types.\n\nSo, the code steps would be:\n\n1. Import necessary modules.\n\n2. Create a simulation class that inherits from SteppableBasePy.\n\n3. In the __init__ method, initialize the contact plugin.\n\n4. In the start method:\n\n   a. Define cell types (Mesenchymal and Medium).\n\n   b. Set contact energies between cell types.\n\n   c. Create initial cells (e.g., a cluster of mesenchymal cells surrounded by medium).\n\n   d. Set volume and surface constraints for the cells.\n\n5. In the step method, maybe adjust some parameters over time, but the user didn't specify, so perhaps leave it empty or add a basic print statement.\n\nPutting this into code:\n\nFirst, the imports:\n\nimport CompuCellSetup\nfrom PySteppables import SteppableBasePy\n\nThen, the simulation class:\n\nclass MorphogenesisSteppable(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, simulator, frequency=1):\n        super().__init__(simulator, frequency)\n        self.contact_plugin = None\n\n    def start(self):\n        # Define cell types\n        mesenchymal_type = self.cell_type(\"Mesenchymal\")\n        medium_type = self.cell_type(\"Medium\")\n        \n        # Set contact energies\n        self.contact_plugin.set_contact_energy(\"Mesenchymal\", \"Mesenchymal\", 10)\n        self.contact_plugin.set_contact_energy(\"Mesenchymal\", \"Medium\", 15)\n        self.contact_plugin.set_contact_energy(\"Medium\", \"Medium\", 5)\n        \n        # Create initial cell layout\n        cell = self.new_cell(self.cell_type.MESENCHYMAL)\n        self.cell_field[25:35, 25:35, 0] = cell\n        \n        # Set volume and surface parameters\n        self.cell_volume_plugin.set_volume_parameters(cell, target_volume=25, lambda_volume=2.0)\n        self.cell_volume_plugin.set_surface_parameters(cell, target_surface=20, lambda_surface=1.5)\n    \n    def step(self, mcs):\n        # Example step behavior: adjust properties based on mcs\n        pass\n\nWait, but in the start method, how are the cell types defined? Maybe using self.c",
