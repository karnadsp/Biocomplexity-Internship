    "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file based on the given ontology annotations. The user provided a Python code example, but I have to create my own. Let me break down the requirements.\n\nFirst, the code must include the necessary imports. I remember that CompuCell3D uses modules like CompuCellSetup and various steppables. So I'll import CompuCellSetup, SteppableBasePy, and maybe some Py modules from steppables.\n\nNext, the simulation class should inherit from SteppableBasePy. I'll name it something relevant, like CellProliferationSimulation. This class needs the __init__, start, and step methods.\n\nIn the __init__ method, I'll call the superclass's __init__ and set the priority. I think higher priority numbers run later, so I'll set it to 10. Also, I'll initialize a variable to track the number of steps.\n\nThe start method is called once at the beginning. Here, I'll set up the simulation, like initializing cell types. I'll use the ontology terms provided: Epithelial, Cell Division, and Cell Proliferation. I'll register these cell types with the simulation.\n\nIn the step method, I'll put logic that runs every simulation step. For this example, I'll add a simple print statement to show the step number. I'll also include a counter to track the number of steps and stop the simulation after a certain number, say 100 steps.\n\nI should also include the main function to run the simulation. It initializes the simulation object, sets the output directory, and runs the simulation. I'll set the number of steps to 100 and the output frequency to 10.\n\nI need to make sure the code is clean and only includes the necessary parts without any extra text. I'll structure it properly, ensuring all methods and imports are correctly placed.\n\nWait, in the example, the user used print statements in the methods. I should include similar placeholders for user-specific logic. Maybe in the step method, I can add a print statement that shows the current step, and in the start method, a print to indicate the simulation has started.\n\nI also need to handle the stopping condition. In the step method, after a certain number of steps, I'll call self.stopSimulation().\n\nLet me put it all together. I'll start by importing the necessary modules, then define the simulation class with the required methods. In the main function, I'll initialize everything and run the simulation.\n\nI think that's all. Now, I'll write the code accordingly, making sure it's valid and follows the structure required by CompuCell3D.\n</think>\n\n```python\nfrom CompuCell3D import SteppableBasePy, PySteppable\nfrom CompuCell3D.PyModules import Cell\nfrom CompuCell3D import Simulations\n\nclass CellProliferationSimulation(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, _simulator, _frequency=1):\n        SteppableBasePy.__init__(self, _simulator, _frequency)\n        self.simulator = _simulator\n        self.step_number = 0\n        self.priority = 10  # Higher priority to run after other steppables\n\n    def start(self):\n        # Initialize simulation with cell types and parameters\n        self.cell_type = self.simulator.get_cell_type('Epithelial')\n        self.cell_division = self.simulator.get_cell_type('Cell Division')\n        self.cell_proliferation = self.simulator.get_cell_type('Cell Proliferation')\n        print(\"Simulation started with cell types: Epithelial, Cell Division, Cell Proliferation\")\n\n    def step(self):\n        # Logic to handle cell proliferation and division\n        self.step_number += 1\n        print(f\"Simulation step: {self.step_number}\")\n        if self.step_number >= 100:\n            self.stopSimulation()\n\ndef main():\n    simulator = Simulations()\n    simulation = CellProliferationSimulation(simulator)\n    simulator.add_steppable(simulation)\n    simulator.set_output_directory(\"output\")\n    simulator.run(100, 10)  # Run 100 steps, output every 10 steps\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```"
