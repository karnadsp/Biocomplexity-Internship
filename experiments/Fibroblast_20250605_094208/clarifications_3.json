    "questions": "Here are specific clarification questions to help identify relevant Cell Ontology (CL), Gene Ontology (GO), and MeSH terms for the described system:  \n\n### **Cell Ontology (CL) Clarifications:**  \n1. Is the epithelial tissue in the cylindrical segment stratified, simple, or pseudostratified?  \n2. Are the fibroblasts specifically myofibroblasts or another subtype?  \n3. Does the epithelial tissue have specialized features (e.g., ciliated, secretory, keratinized)?  \n4. Is the lumen lined by a specific epithelial cell type (e.g., columnar, cuboidal, squamous)?  \n\n### **Gene Ontology (GO) Clarifications:**  \n5. Are there any known molecular functions (e.g., secretion, barrier formation) associated with this epithelial structure?  \n6. Are there biological processes (e.g., morphogenesis, wound healing) relevant to the fibroblasts' role?  \n7. Are there cellular components (e.g., tight junctions, basement membrane) critical to this structure?  \n\n### **MeSH Term Clarifications:**  \n8. Is this structure part of a specific organ system (e.g., digestive, respiratory, vascular)?  \n9. Are there disease or developmental contexts (e.g., fibrosis, tubular formation) associated with this system?  \n10. Are there extracellular matrix components (e.g., collagen, fibronectin) involved in fibroblast-epithelial interactions?  \n\nThese questions will help refine ontology term selection for accurate modeling. Would additional context (e.g., species, developmental stage) further improve specificity?"
