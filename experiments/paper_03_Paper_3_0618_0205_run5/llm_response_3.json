    "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file based on the given ontology annotations. The user provided a Python code example, but I have to create my own. Let me break down the requirements.\n\nFirst, the code must include the necessary imports. I remember that CompuCell3D uses modules like CompuCellSetup and steppables. So I'll import CompuCellSetup, and from steppables, I'll need SteppableBasePy. Also, I think I'll need the simulator and the PyLeonardo module for visualization, so I'll import those as well.\n\nNext, the simulation class should inherit from SteppableBasePy. I'll name it something relevant, maybe EpithelialCellSimulation. This class needs to have __init__, start, and step methods.\n\nIn the __init__ method, I'll call the superclass's __init__ and set the priority. I think the priority is important for the order of operations, so I'll set it to 1.\n\nThe start method is where I'll initialize the simulation. I'll create a dictionary for cell types, adding 'Epithelial' with a color. Then, I'll set the default cell type to 'Epithelial'. I'll also set the simulation to run for a certain number of steps, say 1000, and output frequency for the PyLeonardo module.\n\nIn the step method, I'll put any logic that happens every time step. For this example, I'll just print out the current step to show it's running.\n\nI also need to include the main function to run the simulation. I'll create an instance of the simulation class, set the output directory, and run the simulation.\n\nI should make sure that the code is clean and only includes the necessary parts without any extra text. I'll structure it so that each part is clearly defined and follows CompuCell3D conventions.\n\nWait, I should double-check the imports. I think I might need to import the PyLeonardo module correctly. Also, in the start method, I need to make sure I'm using the correct method to set the default cell type and create the cell type dictionary.\n\nI think that's all. Now, I'll put it all together into a Python script that meets the user's requirements.\n</think>\n\n```python\nfrom CompuCell3D import CompuCellSetup\nfrom steppables import SteppableBasePy\nfrom CompuCell3D.simulator import Simulator\nfrom CompuCell3D.PyLeonardo import PyLeonardo\n\nclass EpithelialCellSimulation(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, _simulator, _frequency=1):\n        super(EpithelialCellSimulation, self).__init__(_simulator, _frequency)\n        self.simulator = _simulator\n        self.step = 0\n        self.simulatorThread = None\n\n    def start(self):\n        self.simulatorThread = self.simulator.getSimulatorThread()\n        self.cellType = {'Epithelial': {'color': [255, 255, 255]}}\n        self.simulator.setDefaultCellType(self.cellType['Epithelial'])\n        self.simulator.setSimulationDuration(1000)\n        self.simulator.getPyLeonardo().setOutputDirectory(\"EpithelialSimulation\")\n\n    def step(self, mcs):\n        self.step += 1\n        print(\"Simulation step: \", mcs)\n\ndef main():\n    simulator = Simulator()\n    simulator.setSimulationDimensions(100, 100, 1)\n    simulator.setSimulationTime(1, 1000)\n    simulator.addSteerable(EpithelialCellSimulation(simulator, 1))\n    simulator.run()\n    PyLeonardo().run()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```"
