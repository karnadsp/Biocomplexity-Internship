    "prompt": "Original description: This paper presents simulations of in vitro Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). The conditions of 2D migration on the surface, and 3D invasion into a collagen gel are represented as a cellular Potts model. The model demonstrates that a loss of endocardial adhesion is a sufficient condition for 2D migration behaviour, while a simultaneous loss of endocardial cohesion and gain in endocardial to collagen gel adhesion is a sufficient condition for 3D invasion. The 3D model captures the hierarchy effective surface tensions that correspond to the three experimental conditions of stable monolayer, 2D migration, and 3D invasion. A 2D cellular Potts model is used to investigate the relationship between cell shape changes, motility and adhesion during the condition of 2D migration.\n\nClarifications provided: \n\n\n    Return ONLY a JSON object with ontology annotations.",

    "response": "<think> \n Okay ,  I  need  to  create  a  JSON  object  with  ontology  annotations  based  on  the  provided  paper  description .  The  user  wants  me  to  include  terms  from  Cell  Ont ology ,  GO ,  and  Me SH  where  applicable .  \n\n First ,  I 'll  read  through  the  paper  description  to  understand  the  key  concepts .  The  paper  is  about  simulations  of  Ep ith elial  to  Mes ench ym al  Transition  ( EM T )  in  vitro .  They  use  a  cellular  P otts  model  to  simulate   2 D  migration  on  a  surface  and   3 D  invasion  into  a  collagen  gel .  The  model  shows  that  losing  end ocard ial  ad hesion  is  enough  for   2 D  migration ,  while  losing  cohesion  and  gaining  ad hesion  to  collagen  enables   3 D  invasion .  The   3 D  model  captures  surface  tensions  corresponding  to  three  experimental  conditions :  stable  mon ol ayer ,   2 D  migration ,  and   3 D  invasion .  A   2 D  model  investigates  cell  shape  changes ,  mot ility ,  and  ad hesion  during   2 D  migration .\n\n Now ,  I 'll  break  this  down  into  different  ontology  categories .\n\n For  Cell  Ont ology ,  the  main  cell  types  involved  are  Ep ith elial  Cells  and  Mes ench ym al  Cells  since  E MT  is  about  their  transition .  The  cellular  processes  include  cell  migration ,  ad hesion ,  and  cohesion .  So ,  I 'll  map  these  to  their  respective  Cell  Ont ology  IDs .\n\n Next ,  Gene  Ont ology  ( GO )  terms .  E MT  is  a  biological  process ,  so  GO : 000 175 1 .  Cell  migration  is  GO : 001 647 7 .  Cell  ad hesion  is  GO : 000 715 5 ,  and  cell  mot ility  is  GO : 004 887 0 .  These  should  cover  the  biological  processes  described .\n\n Moving  to  Me SH  terms ,  E MT  isn 't  a  direct  Me SH  term ,  but  Ep ith elial -M es ench ym al  Transition  is .  Cell  migration  and  ad hesion  are  also  Me SH  terms .  Coll agen  g els  are  part  of  the  model ,  so  that 's  another  Me SH  term .  The  cellular  P otts  model  is  a  computational  method ,  so  I 'll  include  that  as  well .\n\n I  need  to  ensure  each  term  is  correctly  mapped  to  its  ontology .  I 'll  structure  the  JSON  with  separate  sections  for  each  ontology  type ,  listing  the  relevant  terms  with  their  IDs  and  labels .\n\n I  should  double -check  each  term  to  make  sure  they  accurately  represent  the  concepts  in  the  paper .  For  example ,  ensuring  that  the  Cell  Ont ology  terms  for  Ep ith elial  and  Mes ench ym al  cells  are  correct ,  and  that  the  GO  terms  cover  all  the  processes  mentioned .\n\n Finally ,  I 'll  format  the  JSON  without  any  additional  explanations ,  just  the  structure  with  the  terms .  I 'll  make  sure  the  syntax  is  correct ,  with  proper  commas  and  brackets .\n </think> \n\n ``` json \n {\n    \" Cell  Ont ology \":  [\n      {\n        \" id \":  \" CL : 000 005 7 \",\n        \" label \":  \" ep ith elial  cell \"\n      },\n      {\n        \" id \":  \" CL : 000 006 6 \",\n        \" label \":  \" mes ench ym al  cell \"\n      },\n      {\n        \" id \":  \" CL : 000 002 3 \",\n        \" label \":  \" cell \"\n      }\n    ],\n    \" Gene  Ont ology \":  [\n      {\n        \" id \":  \" GO : 000 175 1 \",\n        \" label \":  \" ep ith elial  to  mes ench ym al  transition \"\n      },\n      {\n        \" id \":  \" GO : 001 647 7 \",\n        \" label \":  \" cell  migration \"\n      },\n      {\n        \" id \":  \" GO : 000 715 5 \",\n        \" label \":  \" cell  ad hesion \"\n      },\n      {\n        \" id \":  \" GO : 004 887 0 \",\n        \" label \":  \" cell  mot ility \"\n      }\n    ],\n    \" Me SH \":  [\n      {\n        \" id \":  \" D 000 075 469 \",\n        \" label \":  \" ep ith elial -m es ench ym al  transition \"\n      },\n      {\n        \" id \":  \" D 000 071 601 \",\n        \" label \":  \" cell  migration \"\n      },\n      {\n        \" id \":  \" D 000 071 603 \",\n        \" label \":  \" cell  ad hesion \"\n      },\n      {\n        \" id \":  \" D 000 071 604 \",\n        \" label \":  \" coll agen \"\n      },\n      {\n        \" id \":  \" D 000 071 602 \",\n        \" label \":  \" gel \"\n      }\n    ]\n }\n ``` "
