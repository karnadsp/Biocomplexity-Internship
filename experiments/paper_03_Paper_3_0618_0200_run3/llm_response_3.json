    "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file based on the provided ontology annotations. Let me break down the requirements and figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the user provided an ontology with CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH terms. The CellOntology includes Mesenchymal and Epithelial cells. The GeneOntology includes Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition and Cell Division. The MeSH terms are Cell Proliferation and Differentiation.\n\nI should start by setting up the basic structure of a CompuCell3D simulation. That means importing the necessary modules like CompuCellSetup and the relevant steppables. I'll need to import SteppableBasePy from steppables.\n\nNext, I need to create a simulation class that inherits from SteppableBasePy. This class should have the __init__, start, and step methods. In the __init__, I'll initialize the parent class and set up any parameters specific to the simulation, like the number of cells to seed.\n\nIn the start method, I'll seed the initial cells. Since there are two cell types, I'll create a certain number of each. For example, 50 Epithelial and 50 Mesenchymal cells. I'll place them randomly in the simulation area.\n\nNow, considering the biological processes from the ontology: Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), Cell Division, Proliferation, and Differentiation. I'll need to model these processes.\n\nFor EMT, I can create a steppable that switches a cell's type from Epithelial to Mesenchymal at a certain probability each step. Similarly, I can have a steppable for cell division where each cell divides at a given probability, creating a new cell of the same type.\n\nI'll need to define the probabilities for EMT and division. These can be parameters set in the simulation class. Also, I'll set the simulation dimensions and other necessary parameters like the number of steps.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll structure the code with the imports, the simulation class, and the EMT and division steppables. Each steppable will be added to the simulation in the start method.\n\nI should make sure that the code is clean and only includes the necessary parts without any extra explanations or text. The user wants only the Python code, so I'll ensure that's all that's included.\n\nFinally, I'll test the structure in my mind to make sure all required methods are present and that the logic for cell behavior is correctly implemented based on the ontology terms provided.\n</think>\n\n```python\nfrom CompuCell3D import CompuCellSetup\nfrom steppables import SteppableBasePy\n\nclass Simulation(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, _simulator, _frequency=1):\n        SteppableBasePy.__init__(self, _simulator, _frequency)\n        self.simulator = _simulator\n        self.frequency = _frequency\n        self.num_cells = 100\n        self.EMT_rate = 0.01\n        self.division_rate = 0.05\n\n    def start(self):\n        self.simulator.getSimulationDimensions()\n        self.create_cells()\n\n    def create_cells(self):\n        cell_type_epithelial = 'Epithelial'\n        cell_type_mesenchymal = 'Mesenchymal'\n        \n        for _ in range(self.num_cells//2):\n            cell = self.simulator.createCell()\n            cell.cellType = cell_type_epithelial\n            self.simulator.addCellToSimulation(cell)\n            \n        for _ in range(self.num_cells//2):\n            cell = self.simulator.createCell()\n            cell.cellType = cell_type_mesenchymal\n            self.simulator.addCellToSimulation(cell)\n\n    def step(self):\n        self.handle_EMT()\n        self.handle_cell_division()\n\n    def handle_EMT(self):\n        for cell in self.simulator.cellList:\n            if cell.cellType == 'Epithelial':\n                if self.EMT_rate > self.simulator.random()\n                    cell.cellType = 'Mesenchymal'\n\n    def handle_cell_division(self):\n        for cell in self.simulator.cellList:\n            if self.division_rate > self.simulator.random()\n                self.simulator.divideCellRandomOrientation(cell)\n\ndef main():\n    sim = CompuCellSetup.Simulator()\n    sim.simulationDimensions = (100, 100, 1)\n    sim.setSimulationTime(100, 100)\n    sim.addSteppable(Simulation(sim, 1))\n    sim.run()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```"
