    "questions": "Here are specific clarification questions to better understand the system and identify relevant ontologies (Cell Ontology, Gene Ontology, and MeSH terms):  \n\n1. **Cell Types & Structure**:  \n   - Are the epithelial cells in the cylindrical segment of a specific subtype (e.g., simple columnar, stratified squamous)?  \n   - Do the fibroblasts have any distinguishing features (e.g., activated fibroblasts, myofibroblasts)?  \n   - Is there any mention of additional cell types (e.g., immune cells, endothelial cells) in or around the structure?  \n\n2. **Biological Function & Process (GO)**:  \n   - What is the primary function of this structure (e.g., secretion, absorption, mechanical support)?  \n   - Are there any key biological processes involved (e.g., extracellular matrix organization, epithelial-mesenchymal signaling)?  \n   - Are there specific molecular functions (e.g., ion transport, collagen binding) relevant to this system?  \n\n3. **Anatomical Context (MeSH)**:  \n   - Is this structure part of a specific organ or tissue system (e.g., digestive tract, blood vessel, gland)?  \n   - Does the lumen contain any fluid or substances (e.g., mucus, blood, digestive enzymes)?  \n   - Are there spatial or developmental relationships (e.g., embryonic origin, regional specialization)?  \n\n4. **Disease or Experimental Context**:  \n   - Is this system modeling a healthy or pathological state (e.g., fibrosis, tumor microenvironment)?  \n   - Are there any associated diseases or conditions (e.g., inflammatory disorders, cancer)?  \n\n5. **Additional Features**:  \n   - Are there extracellular matrix components (e.g., collagen, fibronectin) that should be considered?  \n   - Are there any signaling pathways (e.g., TGF-\u03b2, Wnt) known to be active in this system?  \n\nThese questions will help refine ontology term selection for accurate representation."
