    "response": "<think>\nAlright, so the user has given me a query where they want me to act as a biological modeling expert. They need me to create structured ontology annotations based on the provided information. The key here is to include relevant terms from Cell Ontology, Gene Ontology (GO), and MeSH. They also specified that I should return only a JSON object with specific category names and formatting.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original description they provided. It seems like they included some placeholder terms like \"Epithelial\", \"Mesenchymal\", \"Cell Division\", and \"Cell Proliferation\". My task is to map these terms to their respective ontology IDs.\n\nStarting with Cell Ontology, I know that \"Epithelial\" corresponds to CL:0000057. Similarly, \"Mesenchymal\" should be CL:0000060. For Gene Ontology, \"Cell Division\" is GO:0000280, and \"Cell Proliferation\" under MeSH is D000000. Wait, but in the example, MeSH uses D followed by six digits, so I need to ensure the IDs are correctly formatted without spaces.\n\nI also need to make sure the category names are exact: \"CellOntology\", \"GeneOntology\", and \"MeSH\". No extra spaces or different capitalizations. The IDs should be without any spaces, so \"CL:0000057\" is correct, not \"CL : 000 0057\".\n\nNow, I'll structure the JSON accordingly. Each category will have an array of objects, each containing \"id\" and \"term\". I'll double-check each term to ensure they're exact and match the provided example.\n\nI think that's all. I'll format the JSON without any explanations, as the user specifically asked for only the JSON object.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000057\",\n            \"term\": \"Epithelial\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000060\",\n            \"term\": \"Mesenchymal\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0000280\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Division\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D000000\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Proliferation\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```"
