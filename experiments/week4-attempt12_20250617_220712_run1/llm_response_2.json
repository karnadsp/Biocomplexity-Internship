    "prompt": "Original description: This paper presents simulations of in vitro Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). The conditions of 2D migration on the surface, and 3D invasion into a collagen gel are represented as a cellular Potts model. The model demonstrates that a loss of endocardial adhesion is a sufficient condition for 2D migration behaviour, while a simultaneous loss of endocardial cohesion and gain in endocardial to collagen gel adhesion is a sufficient condition for 3D invasion. The 3D model captures the hierarchy effective surface tensions that correspond to the three experimental conditions of stable monolayer, 2D migration, and 3D invasion. A 2D cellular Potts model is used to investigate the relationship between cell shape changes, motility and adhesion during the condition of 2D migration.\n\nClarifications provided: \n\n\n    Return ONLY a JSON object with ontology annotations.",

    "response": "<think> \n Okay ,  so  I  need  to  create  a  JSON  object  with  ontology  annotations  based  on  the  provided  information .  The  user  has  specified  that  I  should  use  Cell  Ont ology ,  GO ,  and  Me SH  terms  where  applicable .  Let  me  break  down  the  original  description  and  clar ifications  to  extract  the  relevant  terms .\n\n First ,  the  paper  is  about  simulations  of  Ep ith elial  to  Mes ench ym al  Transition  ( EM T )  in  vitro .  So  E MT  is  a  key  term .  I 'll  need  to  find  the  corresponding  terms  in  each  ontology .\n\n Looking  at  the  conditions  described :   2 D  migration  on  a  surface  and   3 D  invasion  into  a  collagen  gel .  These  are  cellular  behaviors ,  so  I  should  find  terms  related  to  cell  migration  and  invasion .  Also ,  the  model  used  is  a  cellular  P otts  model ,  which  is  a  computational  method ,  so  I 'll  need  terms  related  to  that .\n\n The  model  shows  that  loss  of  end ocard ial  ad hesion  is  sufficient  for   2 D  migration ,  while  loss  of  cohesion  and  increased  ad hesion  to  collagen  gel  enables   3 D  invasion .  So  terms  related  to  cell  ad hesion ,  cohesion ,  and  specifically  end ocard ial  cells  are  important .\n\n The   3 D  model  captures  surface  tensions  corresponding  to  stable  mon ol ayer ,   2 D  migration ,  and   3 D  invasion .  So  terms  related  to  cell  shape  changes ,  mot ility ,  and  ad hesion  during   2 D  migration  are  also  relevant .\n\n Now ,  mapping  these  to  the  ont ologies :\n\n Cell  Ont ology  ( CL )  terms :\n -  Ep ith elial  cell  ( CL : 000 005 7 )\n -  Mes ench ym al  cell  ( CL : 000 036 6 )\n -  End ocard ial  cell  ( CL : 000 254 2 )\n -  Coll agen  gel  ( I 'm  not  sure  if  there 's  a  specific  CL  term  for  this ,  maybe  under  extr acellular  matrix  components )\n -  Cellular  P otts  model  ( CL : 000 070 0 )\n\n GO  terms :\n -  Ep ith elial  to  mes ench ym al  transition  ( GO : 001 071 8 )\n -  Cell  migration  ( GO : 001 647 7 )\n -  Cell  ad hesion  ( GO : 000 715 5 )\n -  Cell  mot ility  ( GO : 004 001 2 )\n -  Cell  shape  changes  ( GO : 003 003 2 )\n -  Extr acellular  matrix  ( GO : 003 101 2 )\n\n Me SH  terms :\n -  Ep ith elial -M es ench ym al  Transition  ( D 053 595 )\n -  Cell  Migration  ( D 002 469 )\n -  Cell  Ad hesion  ( D 002 469 )\n -  Coll agen  ( D 003 094 )\n -  Models ,  Biological  ( D 001 490 )\n -  Computer  Simulation  ( D 016 211 )\n\n I  think  I 've  covered  all  the  necessary  terms .  Now ,  I 'll  structure  them  into  a  JSON  object  with  each  ontology  as  a  key  and  an  array  of  terms  as  values .\n </think> \n\n ``` json \n {\n    \" Cell  Ont ology \":  [\n      \" Ep ith elial  cell  ( CL : 000 005 7 )\",\n      \" Mes ench ym al  cell  ( CL : 000 036 6 )\",\n      \" End ocard ial  cell  ( CL : 000 254 2 )\",\n      \" Coll agen  gel \",\n      \" Cell ular  P otts  model  ( CL : 000 070 0 )\"\n    ],\n    \" Gene  Ont ology \":  [\n      \" Ep ith elial  to  mes ench ym al  transition  ( GO : 001 071 8 )\",\n      \" Cell  migration  ( GO : 001 647 7 )\",\n      \" Cell  ad hesion  ( GO : 000 715 5 )\",\n      \" Cell  mot ility  ( GO : 004 001 2 )\",\n      \" Cell  shape  changes  ( GO : 003 003 2 )\",\n      \" Ex tr acellular  matrix  ( GO : 003 101 2 )\"\n    ],\n    \" Me SH \":  [\n      \" Ep ith elial -M es ench ym al  Transition  ( D 053 595 )\",\n      \" Cell  Migration  ( D 002 469 )\",\n      \" Cell  Ad hesion  ( D 002 469 )\",\n      \" Coll agen  ( D 003 094 )\",\n      \" Models ,  Biological  ( D 001 490 )\",\n      \" Computer  Simulation  ( D 016 211 )\"\n    ]\n }\n ``` "
