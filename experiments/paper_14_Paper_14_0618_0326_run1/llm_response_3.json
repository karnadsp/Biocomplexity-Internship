    "response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file based on the provided ontology annotations. Let me break down the requirements and figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the user provided specific ontology terms: Epithelial cells, Cell proliferation, and Cell Proliferation. So, the simulation should model the proliferation of epithelial cells.\n\nI'll start by setting up the basic structure of the simulation. I know that CompuCell3D uses Python scripts, so I'll need to import the necessary modules. The main ones are CompuCellSetup and steppables, which include the SteppableBasePy class.\n\nNext, I'll create a simulation class that inherits from SteppableBasePy. This class will handle the logic for cell behavior. The required methods are __init__, start, and step. \n\nIn the __init__ method, I'll initialize the simulation, set the number of cells, and define the cell type. Since the focus is on epithelial cells, I'll create a single cell of this type placed at the center of a 2D lattice.\n\nThe start method is where I'll set up initial conditions. I'll set a high proliferation rate for the epithelial cells to simulate rapid growth, as indicated by the ontology terms.\n\nIn the step method, I'll handle the cell division logic. I'll loop through each cell, check if it's an epithelial cell, and if so, trigger mitosis every 50 simulation steps. This will cause the cells to proliferate over time.\n\nI also need to ensure that the simulation runs for a sufficient number of steps to observe the proliferation. I'll set the simulation to run for 1000 steps, which should be enough to see noticeable cell growth.\n\nI should make sure that the code is clean and only includes the necessary parts without any extra explanations or text. The user specifically asked for only the Python code, so I'll avoid adding comments or print statements unless they're essential for the simulation's functionality.\n\nFinally, I'll review the code to ensure it meets all the requirements: correct imports, proper class structure with the required methods, and accurate modeling of cell proliferation based on the provided ontologies.\n</think>\n\n```python\nfrom CompuCellSetup import Simulate, Inventory\nfrom steppables import SteppableBasePy\n\nclass EpithelialProliferationSimulation(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, _simulator, _num_cells):\n        SteppableBasePy.__init__(self, _simulator)\n        self.num_cells = _num_cells\n        self.inventory = Inventory(self.simulator)\n        \n        # Initialize cell type and properties\n        self.cell_type = 'Epithelial'\n        self.cell_properties = {'proliferation_rate': 1.0}\n        \n    def start(self):\n        # Set initial cell positions and types\n        self.simulator.add_cells(self.num_cells, self.cell_type, self.cell_properties)\n        \n    def step(self):\n        # Implement cell proliferation logic\n        for cell in self.simulator.get_cells():\n            if cell.type == self.cell_type:\n                if self.simulator.step_number % 50 == 0:\n                    cell.divide()\n                    \ndef main():\n    simulator = Simulate()\n    simulation = EpithelialProliferationSimulation(simulator, num_cells=1)\n    simulator.add_steppable(simulation)\n    simulator.run(1000)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```"
