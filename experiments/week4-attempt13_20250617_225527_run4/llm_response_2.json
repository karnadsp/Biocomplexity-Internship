    "prompt": "Original description: This paper presents simulations of in vitro Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). The conditions of 2D migration on the surface, and 3D invasion into a collagen gel are represented as a cellular Potts model. The model demonstrates that a loss of endocardial adhesion is a sufficient condition for 2D migration behaviour, while a simultaneous loss of endocardial cohesion and gain in endocardial to collagen gel adhesion is a sufficient condition for 3D invasion. The 3D model captures the hierarchy effective surface tensions that correspond to the three experimental conditions of stable monolayer, 2D migration, and 3D invasion. A 2D cellular Potts model is used to investigate the relationship between cell shape changes, motility and adhesion during the condition of 2D migration.\n\nClarifications provided: \n\n\n    Return ONLY a JSON object with ontology annotations.",

    "response": "<think> \n Alright ,  I  need  to  create  a  JSON  object  with  ontology  annotations  based  on  the  provided  description  of  a  biological  modeling  paper .  The  user  has  specified  that  I  should  use  Cell  Ont ology ,  GO ,  and  Me SH  terms  where  applicable .  \n\n First ,  I 'll  parse  the  original  description  to  identify  key  biological  concepts .  The  paper  discusses  simulations  of  Ep ith elial  to  Mes ench ym al  Transition  ( EM T ),  specifically  in  vitro .  So ,  I 'll  note  E MT  as  a  biological  process .\n\n The  models  mentioned  are   2 D  migration  on  a  surface  and   3 D  invasion  into  a  collagen  gel .  These  are  types  of  cell  migration ,  so  I 'll  include  terms  related  to  cell  migration  and  invasion .\n\n The  cellular  P otts  model  is  used ,  which  falls  under  computational  modeling .  I 'll  need  to  find  the  appropriate  GO  term  for  that .\n\n The  conditions  described  involve  loss  of  end ocard ial  ad hesion  and  cohesion ,  and  increased  ad hesion  to  collagen  gel .  These  relate  to  cell  ad hesion  properties ,  so  I 'll  include  terms  for  cell  ad hesion  and  cohesion .\n\n The  model  also  captures  effective  surface  tensions  corresponding  to  stable  mon ol ayer ,   2 D  migration ,  and   3 D  invasion .  Surface  tension  in  a  biological  context  might  relate  to  cell -cell  ad hesion  or  the  physical  properties  of  cell  aggregates .\n\n Cell  shape  changes  and  mot ility  are  investigated ,  so  terms  for  cell  shape  and  mot ility  should  be  included .\n\n Now ,  I 'll  map  these  concepts  to  the  relevant  ont ologies .  For  Cell  Ont ology ,  terms  like  \" ep ith elial  cell \"  and  \" mes ench ym al  cell \"  are  relevant .  GO  terms  will  cover  biological  processes  like  E MT ,  cell  migration ,  ad hesion ,  and  mot ility .  Me SH  terms  will  include  broader  categories  like  Models ,  Biological  and  Computer  Simulation .\n\n I 'll  structure  the  JSON  with  separate  categories  for  each  ontology  type ,  listing  the  applicable  terms .  I 'll  make  sure  not  to  include  any  explanations ,  just  the  JSON  object  as  per  the  user 's  instruction .\n </think> \n\n ``` json \n {\n    \" Cell  Ont ology \":  [\n      \" ep ith elial  cell \",\n      \" mes ench ym al  cell \",\n      \" end ocard ial  cell \"\n    ],\n    \" Gene  Ont ology \":  [\n      \" ep ith elial  to  mes ench ym al  transition \",\n      \" cell  migration \",\n      \" cell  ad hesion \",\n      \" cell  cohesion \",\n      \" cell  mot ility \",\n      \" cell  shape \",\n      \" coll agen  gel  ad hesion \",\n      \" surface  tension \"\n    ],\n    \" Me SH \":  [\n      \" Models ,  Biological \",\n      \" Computer  Simulation \",\n      \" Cell  Migration \",\n      \" Ep ith elial -M es ench ym al  Transition \",\n      \" Cell  Ad hesion \",\n      \" Coll agen \",\n      \" G els \",\n      \" Surface  T ension \"\n    ]\n }\n ``` "
