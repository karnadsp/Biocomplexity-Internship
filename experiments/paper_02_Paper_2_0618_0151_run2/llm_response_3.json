    "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file based on the given ontology annotations. The user provided a Python code example that includes imports, a simulation class, and some basic setup. I should follow that structure but make sure it's correct and includes all necessary parts.\n\nFirst, I'll start by importing the required modules. I know that CompuCell3D uses the CompuCellSetup module, and steppables are important for defining simulation steps. So I'll import CompuCellSetup and the necessary steppables.\n\nNext, I need to create a simulation class that inherits from SteppableBasePy. This class should have __init__, start, and step methods. In the __init__, I'll set the frequency and priority for when this steppable runs. The start method is where I'll initialize cell types and set their properties, like color and layer. I'll also add a mitosis steppable to handle cell division.\n\nLooking at the ontology annotations, the simulation involves Epithelial cells, Cell Division, and Cell Proliferation. So I'll define the cell type as Epithelial with an ID. I'll set parameters like cell color, layer, and mitosis parameters such as the maximum distance for daughter cells and duration of mitosis.\n\nI'll make sure the code is clean and only includes the necessary parts without any extra text. I'll also ensure that the code is properly indented and follows Python syntax.\n\nFinally, I'll include the main block to run the simulation, creating an instance of the simulation class and starting CompuCellSetup.\n</think>\n\n```python\nfrom CompuCell3D import CompuCellSetup\nfrom steppables import SteppableBasePy, Mitosis\n\nclass Simulation(SteppableBasePy):\n    def __init__(self, _simulator, _frequency=1):\n        SteppableBasePy.__init__(self, _simulator, _frequency)\n        self.simulator = _simulator\n        self.frequency = _frequency\n        self.priority = 0\n\n    def start(self):\n        self.simulator.add_steppable(_steppable=Mitosis())\n        self.simulator.cell_types['Epithelial'] = {'color': [255, 255, 255], 'layer': 0}\n        self.simulator.add_cell_type(_type_id=1, _name='Epithelial')\n        self.simulator.set.mitosis(_max_distance=5, _mitosis_duration=10)\n\n    def step(self, mcs):\n        pass\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    sim = Simulation(None)\n    CompuCellSetup.run()\n```"
