    "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a valid CompuCell3D simulation file based on the given ontology annotations. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the user provided an example where they used specific imports, a simulation class inheriting from SteppableBasePy, and included methods like __init__, start, and step. They also set up basic cell types and parameters using the ontology annotations.\n\nLooking at the ontology terms, I see 'Epithelial (CL:0000000)', 'Cell Division (GO:0000000)', and 'Cell Proliferation (D000000)'. These suggest that the simulation should model epithelial cells undergoing division and proliferation.\n\nI'll start by importing the necessary modules: CompuCellSetup, which is essential for setting up the simulation, and the specific steppables like PySteppable, which allows Python-based steppables.\n\nNext, I'll create a simulation class, EpithelialProliferationSimulation, that inherits from SteppableBasePy. This class will need the __init__, start, and step methods.\n\nIn the __init__ method, I'll set the simulation name and initialize the simulation using CompuCellSetup. I'll also set the number of cells, the time step, and the total number of steps. For the cell types, I'll define an Epithelial cell type with appropriate parameters like cell size, nucleus size, and stiffness.\n\nThe start method will be called once at the beginning of the simulation. Here, I'll create a single Epithelial cell placed at the origin. I'll also set up a mitosis steppable to handle cell division, specifying the number of daughter cells and the mitosis distance.\n\nIn the step method, which runs every time step, I'll handle cell proliferation. I'll check each cell's volume and, if it exceeds a threshold, trigger mitosis. This ensures that cells grow and divide based on their volume, simulating proliferation.\n\nI need to make sure that the parameters are correctly set, such as the volume growth rate, mitosis distance, and the maximum volume before division. These parameters control how quickly cells grow and when they divide.\n\nFinally, I'll create an instance of the simulation class and run it using the CompuCellSetup.run() method, passing the simulation instance and the number of steps.\n\nI should ensure that all the necessary modules are imported and that the class structure is correctly defined. Also, I need to make sure that the cell types and parameters align with the ontology annotations provided, focusing on epithelial cells and their proliferation through division.\n\nPutting it all together, the code should set up a simulation where epithelial cells grow, reach a certain size, and then divide, continuing this process for the specified number of steps. This should model the basic behavior described by the ontology terms.\n</think>\n\n```python\nfrom CompuCell3D import CompuCellSetup\nfrom cc3d.core import PySteppable\n\nclass EpithelialProliferationSimulation(PySteppable):\n    def __init__(self):\n        PySteppable.__init__(self)\n        self.simulation_name = \"EpithelialProliferation\"\n        self.sim = CompuCellSetup.Simulation()\n        self.sim.setSimulationName(self.simulation_name)\n        self.sim.setNumberOfSteps(100)\n        self.sim.setTimeStep(1.0)\n        self.sim.setTimeOutputInterval(10)\n        \n        # Cell type definition\n        self.cell_type = \"Epithelial\"\n        self.cell_parameters = {\n            \"cellType\": self.cell_type,\n            \"radius\": 5.0,\n            \"nucleusRadius\": 2.0,\n            \"stiffness\": 100.0\n        }\n        \n    def start(self):\n        self.sim.createCell(self.cell_type, self.cell_parameters, position=[0, 0, 0])\n        self.sim.addSteppable(PyMitosis())\n        \n    def step(self, mcs):\n        # Handle cell proliferation\n        for cell in self.sim.cellList:\n            if cell.volume > 100.0:\n                cell.targetVolume = 50.0\n                cell.lambdaVolume = 100.0\n\nclass PyMitosis(PySteppable):\n    def __init__(self):\n        PySteppable.__init__(self)\n        self.mitosis_distance = 5.0\n        self.number_of_daughters = 2\n        \n    def step(self, mcs):\n        for cell in self.sim.cellList:\n            if cell.volume > 100.0:\n                self.sim.mitosis(cell, self.number_of_daughters, self.mitosis_distance)\n\n# Run the simulation\nsim = EpithelialProliferationSimulation()\nCompuCellSetup.run(sim.sim, sim.numberOfSteps)\n```"
