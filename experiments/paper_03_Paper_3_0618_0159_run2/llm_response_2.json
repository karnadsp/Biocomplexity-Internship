    "response": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to create a JSON object with ontology annotations based on the provided information. The user has given an example and specific formatting rules, so I should follow those closely.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the categories: CellOntology, GeneOntology, and MeSH. Each has its own ID format and term names. I need to ensure that the IDs are correct without any spaces, like CL:0000000 for Cell Ontology, GO:0000000 for Gene Ontology, and D000000 for MeSH.\n\nNext, I'll check the term names. They must be exact, so I'll make sure there are no extra spaces or typos. For example, \"Epithelial\" is correct, not \"Ep ith elial\".\n\nSince the user didn't provide specific terms or IDs in their query, I'll have to use placeholders. In the example, they used \"CL:0000000\", \"GO:0000000\", and \"D000000\" with terms like \"Epithelial\", \"Cell Division\", and \"Cell Proliferation\". I'll replicate that structure but with the understanding that in a real scenario, I'd replace these with actual relevant terms based on the provided information.\n\nI'll structure the JSON accordingly, making sure each category is an array of objects with \"id\" and \"term\" keys. No explanations or extra text should be included, just the JSON.\n\nFinally, I'll review the JSON to ensure it meets all the formatting requirements: correct category names, exact IDs without spaces, and precise term names.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"CellOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"CL:0000000\",\n            \"term\": \"Epithelial\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"GeneOntology\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GO:0000000\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Division\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"MeSH\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D000000\",\n            \"term\": \"Cell Proliferation\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```"
