# DermisMaturation
CC3D model of the mouse dermis

The code in this repository corresponds to the 3D CC3D model described in the publication [**Fibroblast state switching orchestrates dermal maturation and wound healing**](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/12/18/236232).

To run the simulations please follow the instructions to install and run [Compucell3D](http://www.compucell3d.org/). For our simulation in particular clone or download all the files in this repo, open Twedit++ and load `DermisMaturation3D.cc3d`.
