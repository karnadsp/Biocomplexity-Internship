def ask_ontology_consistency(reference, comparison):
    prompt = f"""
You are a biomedical ontology comparison assistant. Two ontology extraction outputs are provided: Reference Ontology and Comparison Ontology.

- Evaluate how consistent the Comparison Ontology is relative to the Reference Ontology.
- Focus on:
  - Are the same cell types, biological processes, diseases/context, and parameters extracted?
  - Are any key ontology fields missing or added?
  - Minor differences in exact wording or synonyms are acceptable.
  - Large differences in concept extraction (e.g. missing cell types or wrong processes) are more serious.

Return ONLY:
1. Consistency Rating: 1 (very inconsistent) to 5 (fully consistent)
2. Brief explanation (max 1-2 sentences)

Reference Ontology:
\"\"\"{reference}\"\"\"

Comparison Ontology:
\"\"\"{comparison}\"\"\"
